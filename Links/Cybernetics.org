 Cybernetics, Computer and Art

 For the first time cybernetics and computer technology have crossed each other during the Second World War. In the early years of cybernetics their researchers proposed solutions to control information processes in using circuit diagrams and applications of mathematical laws. In this way the researchers provided foundations for the development of analogue and digital technologies. Cybernetics began with a search for new ways to apply mathematics in the development of solutions for technical tasks, and evolved to a generalising science.

 In the summer of 1947 Norbert Wiener tried to find a title for a book in preparation. He decided to use the term "kybernetes", the "steersman": In controlling the movements of the ship the steersman communicates simultaneously with the ship and with its environment. "Cybernetics Or Control And Communication In The Animal And The Machine" was the name of the book published in 1948: The title points the readers´ interest to features of machines as well as animals. Wiener's term "cybernetics" for a new research field became established.

 For the cyberneticians' interest for computing as a "calculus of reasoning" Wiener regarded Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz as precursor. In 1703 he developed a mathematical universal language – the binary coding of numbers – and from 1672 to 1720 he planned calculating machines for realisations. Leibniz was interested in facilitations of thought processes by technical means and offered the procedure enabling inventors to achieve this objective: Formalisation enables the mechanisation of calculation. 1 With his reference to Leibniz Wiener offers an opportunity to present cybernetics in a Hanoverian series of events on the occasion of the 300th anniversary of the death of the philosopher and mathematician.

 In the fifties and sixties the pioneers of computer art either participated in efforts to develop cybernetic methods (like Gordon Pask) or they were influenced by cybernetics (like Nicolas Schöffer, Georg Nees, Frieder Nake and Herbert Werner Franke).

 The Evolution of the Cybernetic Foundations during the Second World War

 In 1948 two texts provide the basics of cybernetics. Both inform about the research that made them possible: In "Cybernetics Or Control And Communication In The Animal And The Machine" Norbert Wiener mentions the war research in the United States of America, and Claude Elwood Shannon integrates reports on results of this research in "A Mathematical Theory of Communication". 2 With Wiener's and Shannon's contributions to the prediction of flight paths in fire control systems the American research for an anti-aircraft technology became the initiator of cybernetics.

 During the Second World War computing capacities were necessary not only in fire control systems, but also in the cryptography, for whom computers were developed. Via computer-aided cryptography the code of the German Enigma code machine was deciphered.

 The probability theory is useful for predictions if the possibilities of a system and the statistic frequency of previous occurrences of these possibilities are known. The probability theory became fundamental in the cryptography as well as in Wiener's and Shannon's research for predictions of the flight paths chosen by pilots to approach a destination. Anti-aircraft systems and cryptography became new fields for the application of mathematics. 3

 Ballistics WWII

 Ballistics in the Second World War: Predicted fire against moving targets (Gustin: WWII 1998-99).

 An anti-aircraft system receives input data on a moving target and delivers the navigation of a bullet to the target as output. In the time period from input to output the target continues its course. Via computing processes the system must determine possible movements of the target to aggrandize the chances to hit the target. The calculators in anti-aircraft systems of the Second World War were referred to as computers.

 In the circuit of a fire control system the "negative feedback" was important for the control of informations. Great distortions caused by erroneous target tracking were eliminated via filters and a continuous flight path was reconstructed with data smoothing. Thus the data recognized by "negative feedback" were prohibited to initiate the generation of an ouput. 4

 Negative feedback (Apter: Cybernetics 1969, p.259).

 Since 1940 Norbert Wiener had the task 5 to improve the possibilities to predict the flight path of enemy flying objects. Efforts to refine the precision of the prediction tried to fulfill the goal to increase the hit rate of the anti-aircraft in the Battle of Britain. Wiener divided the motion of a flying object in time phases. This procedure allowed to recognise the repetitions and modifications between the phases. 6

 Data produced by soldiers tracking flight objects were used by Wiener as an input of his prediction system. These data were supplied by subjects in a test model – the "antiaircraft predictor" constructed by Julian Bigelow and Paul Mooney. 7 Wiener's application of the theory of probability and statistics was transferred by Shannon to an analysis of relations between time phases in using stochastics' "measurable transition probabilities." 8

C. (Galison: Ontology 1994, p.239).

 Wiener's "theoretical model" 9 for the command devices of anti-aircraft guns takes attacker and persecutor resp. airplane pilot and gun pointer as elements of one system. Airplane pilots and the gun pointers following their traces are reduced to the characteristics relevant for the antiaircraft system. This constitutes a level without differences between humans and machines. In 1956 Norbert Wiener sums up:

     Therefore, in order to obtain as complete a mathematical treatment as possible of the over-all control problem, it is necessary to assimilate the different parts of the system to a single basis, either human or mechanical. Since our understanding of the mechanical elements of gun pointing appeared to us to be far ahead of our psychological understanding, we chose to try to find a mechanical analogue of the gun pointer and the airplane pilot. 10

 During the course of the Second World War the prediction of the airplane pilot´s behavior became increasingly difficult because the airplanes became ever faster and more manoeuvrable. 11 In search for a solution of this problem a research group of the Bell Laboratories – with Shannon as one of the participants – developed the project "Nike-Ajax" as a system for constant corrections of the gun flight path. In 1953 the system was ready to use 12: The answer to an airplane pilot's flight path was the missile's automated recursion of the changing tracking data.

 Since 1937 it was possible to track the target with radar: Thus the amount of incorrect data was reduced. In "Nike-Ajax" the tracking of the target via radar was integrated into the feedback system of a missile reacting in the course of its flight to new input data with changes in direction. 13

 

 Cybernetic Models

 The "material models" developed by cyberneticians for a wayfinding by machines (see below) turn the tracking of targets by anti-aircraft systems to civilian tasks.

 In some research projects a rule defined as the hypothesis of a "theoretical model" and its proof by the processes in a "material model" supplement each other. 14 Computer-aided cybernetic sculptures (see below) take up characteristics of these cybernetic models.

 The "material model" provided the relationships expressed in a "theoretical model" with constructed demonstration material. Hypotheses about processes being crucial for living creatures were exemplified in "material models" constructed with mechanical elements. The "theoretical model" points not only to the relations between the elements used in the "material model" but to these relations as they can be found in other systems with other elements, too.

 In 1946/47 William Ross Ashby constructed a model as a functioning example of his theory of "homeostasis". According to Ashby systems are able to react better to their surroundings if they react internally with many parts to changings caused by external forces in one of its parts: Balancing motions between the directly affected part and other parts aggrandise the capacity to react to environments.

 William Ross Ashby: Design for a Brain 1952/1960, p.101

 Ashby, William Ross: Homeostat, 1946-47 (Ashby: Design 1952/1960, p.101).

 The quadripartite technical system "Homeostat" demonstrated Ashby´s system-wide "law of requisite variety". Knobs on each of the four units made it possible to provoke balancing motions of the system reacting internally to voltage fluctuations: A disturbance too strong for a unit was transmitted to the surrounding units. The deflections of each unit were indicated by needles placed in a conductive fluid. 15

 William Ross Ashby: Desing for a Brain 1952/1960, p.102

 Ashby, William Ross: Homeostat, circuit diagram (Ashby: Design 1952/1960, p.102).

 With its multipart internal differentiation the system was enabled to react in a self-regulating way to disturbances caused by the environement and thus to expand its capacity to react. In a stable overall condition all parts were either in an intermediate position or in opposing limit states compensating each other.

 In 1950 Claude Elwood Shannon constructed a "Maze Solving Machine" 16 with a "sensing finger" capable to memorise the paths already passed through and to return to them after having reached a blind alley: The model demonstrates a path search with a machine´s memory. 17

 Shannon: Maze-Solving Machine 1951

 Shannon, Claude Elwood: Maze-Solving Machine, Plan (Shannon: Presentation 1951/2003, p.174, figure 8).

 Between 1948 and 1951 William Grey Walter developed moving "material models" equipped with sensors for sound, light and touch. Between obstacles the robots found paths to a garage with power supply. "CORA", built in 1951, was able to memorise the obstacles. 18

 In 1953 Walter wrote about "CORA" in his book "The Living Brain" and compared the robot's "electrical oscillation at low frequency" with electroencephalogram (EEG) measurements of brain waves. With these measurements it was possible to recognise if an event was forgotten or memorised and digested. Walter understood his self-navigating robots as material models equivalent to brain activities. 19

 The "material models" presented above exemplify the cybernetic subjects self regulation (Ashby) as well as path detection and memory (Shannon, Wiener). These subjects were discussed before the horizon constituted by contemporary mechanical and electronic technologies, and the validity of hypotheses in biologic systems was tested.

 For the cybernetics originating in the prediction for anti-aircraft control units Wiener presented civilian tasks since the end of the war: He reacted to the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki (1945). 20 Among these tasks were relations between homeostasis and anthropology as well as medicine. 21 Also Ashby and Walter worked on this new orientation while Shannon prepared new weapon systems at the Bell Laboratories: The self orientation of his "Maze Solving Machine" and the self navigation of missiles in the project "Nike Ajax" are civilian and military variants of the same problem area.

 

 Cybernetic Sculptures

 Cybernetic models (see above) contained suggestions for Nicolas Schöffer on how to build cybernetic sculptures (see below). Nevertheless, before Schöffer Gordon Pask, an inventor and author of many texts on cybernetics 22, created the first work of computer art.

 In "An Approach to Cybernetics" (1961) Pask presents "'learning' machines", among them "Eucrates". In 1955 Pask reconstructs the reduced human receptiveness of new input with an electronic learning barrier: After the threshold against the absorption of further informations has grown then the barrier will sink slowly. If new input arrives too late then the system indicates missing input by activities. 23

 Gordon Pask: Eucrates ca. 1956

 Pask, Gordon: Solartron EUCRATES II, c. 1956 (Pask: Approach 1961, pl.I 8(i)).

 From 1953 to 1957 Gordon Pask and Robin McKinnon-Wood developed the reactive system "Musicolour" for stages. In "Musicolour" the principle of "learning machines" like "Eucrates" is varied: If the input into a microphone decreases then a musician will be initiated by a visual output to create new sounds. Thus the musician is able to control the audio-visual relations of performances via his audio input.

 For "Musicolor" Pask and McKinnon-Wood constructed an analog computer. 24 The computer contained sound filters, memory units and elements for the processing of the audio input. The data transformed by the computer caused an output for light projections on a projection screen. This light was modificated by filters producing colour and pattern effects. 25 In a later development phase of the project an electrochemical system was added expanding the possibilities to modificate the light projections. 26

 Gordon Pask: Musicolour system 1954

 Pask, Gordon: Musicolour, 1953-57, circuit diagram (Pask: Comment 1971, p.79, fig. 26).

 Pask described the musician and the machine as parts of a "learning mechanism" with mutual adjustments presupposing learning capabilities of the machine, too. 27 "Musicolour" was a "responsive environment" 28 being integratable in wider performance systems. The environment was a challenge to develop extraordinary performance concepts for the system.

 Pask transformed the possibilities to react, as they were developed in systems integrating humans and machines in the Second World War (see above), and the "material models" of cybernetics to "learning machines" to present examples how machine assistance enhances cognition.

 In 1956 Nicolas Schöffer constructs "CYSP 1" as a mobile kinetic sculpture. Meanwhile the socle moves on rubber wheels and searches its path via self-navigation, the aluminium discs rotate on a steel frame. The motions of the socle and the aluminium discs are coordinated by an "electronic brain" («cerveau électronique») with tube technology. Photoelectric cells and a microphone were installed as sensors to enable "CYSP 1" to register the environment´s modifications of colours, light and sound intensity.

 With Ashby's "Homeostat" (see above) "CYSP 1" has in common the system's proper motion with a random generator and a limited capability to adapt to environmental conditions. Nicolas Schöffer and Jacques Bureau, the constructor of the "electronic brain" integrated into "CYSP 1", describe the functions of cybernetic sculptures like "CYSP 1" in using Ashby's terms "homeostasis" and "homeostat". 29 In "CYSP 1" the controls of the "Homeostat" are substituted by sensors, and the internal balancing between parts as a reaction to disturbances is substituted by a computer installed to process the environmental data for the navigation. The self navigation of William Grey Walter's robots (see above) is superseded in "CYSP 1" by a navigation via electronics. With his sculpture as mobile and self navigating Op Art Schöffer transfers cybernetic models to cybernetic sculptures.

 The motions of aluminium discs characterised "CYSP 1" as an early example of Op Art's kinetic variant. For Abraham André Moles Op Art was a research subject for information aesthetics. Moles submitted the investigation of aesthetic aspects to natural scientific methods (see below).

 Gordon Pasks reactive installation "Colloquy of Mobiles" (1968) consisted of a triangular panel with obtuse-angled corners hanging from the ceiling and three rotating fibreglass bodies with organic forms hanging from the triangular panel. These bodies were illuminated from the inside. Two mobiles with inorganic formed parts were attached to an oblong element rotating under the triangular panel. These mobiles were named by Pask as "Males" and the fibreglass bodies as "Females".

 Electric motors turned the "Males" and "Females" around vertical axes. These motors were controlled by a computer placed closed to a wall and connected with the installation by a cable being mounted on the ceiling. The computer was constructed by Mark Dowson, Gordon Pask and Tony Watts.

 In the "Males" photo cells were installed together with elements to send light to mirrors being mounted in openings of the "Females". The photo cells of the "Males" were able to register the light reflected by the mirrors of the "Females". In their reactions to each other the rotating elements were capable to memorise and to learn. The visitors could change states of the complex stimulus-response-system by interventions with pocket torches: Then the visitors substituted the "Males" in their activity to send light to the "Females'" mirrors.

 Gordon Pask: Colloquy of Mobiles 1968

 Pask, Gordon: Colloquy of Mobiles, 1968, ground plan and elevation of the mobile elements (Pask: Comment 1971, p.90, fig.34).

 After Ashby's "Homeostat" Pask offers with "Colloquy of Mobiles" a further model for the "law of requisite variety" (see above). The "Homeostat" is constituted by subsystems observing themselves mutually as environment. This coordination of subsystems was taken up by Pask in "Colloquy of Mobiles'" kinetic elements reacting to each other. The possibilities of visitors to intervene are caused by Pask's enhancement of the "Homeostat" by capacities to memorise and to learn as well as by the way how the kinetic elements communicate with each other: The system's possibilities to react to external (light) effects are the results of the system's internal differentiation in relations between its parts. This relation between the system and its environment confirms Ashby's "law of requisite variety". 30

 

 Computer Literature

 A combination of elements being documented as having a high occurrence has a higher probability to reappear in the future than a seldom occurring combination. First the computer literature and then the computer graphics were using possibilities limited by criteria of frequencies of occurrences. Then, within these predeterminations, one of the possible occurrences was chosen by chance operations.

 In 1948, in "A Mathematical Theory of Communication", Claude Elwood Shannon proposes to proposes to generate words in using stochastics' combination of probability theory and statistics. The fundament of this generation by combinations of letters consists of statistic data indicating how often certain combinations of two or three letters occur in English words. From the possibilities being limited by statistics of letters sequences – which letters follow one after another – generates a computer via pseudo-random selections letter sequences comparable to words. Shannon proposed to combine words – selected from a database containing English words – to sentences in the same manner as the generation of words: a combination of words guided by statistical probabilities. With the method of repeated uses of statistical criteria for the selection of combination possibilities Shannon tried to demonstrate that "the resemblance to ordinary English text increases quite noticeably". 31

 Shannon's method to generate artificial languages is a variant of a cryptographical method for decoding: An encrypted message is compared with the frequencies of sign combinations in the language used to write the message. 32

 The similarity of an artificial language generated with Shannon's method to the everyday language – simultaneously with the remarkable differences – provided suggestions to authors for the generation of computer literature. Their ways of programming reoccur in computer graphics (see below).

 In June 1952 Christopher Strachey has been employed as "Technical Officer" by the British National Research and Development Corporation. A year earlier he programmed the game Checkers 33 and computer music 34 for British mainframe computers like Manchester Mark I (1948-50) and Ferranti Mark 1 (1951).

 In 1952 Strachey wrote a program to generate "Love Letters" with a Ferranti Mark 1. Words selected from Roget's Thesaurus constituted a database for the program to choose some of the words via random generator. As the words were stored they were combined with syntactical indices (for adverbs, adjectives and substantives). These words were inserted into two sentence structures: "My—[Adjective]—Substantive—[Adverb (adv)]—Verb (verb)—Your—[Adjective]—Substantive" or "You are my—Adjective (adj)—Substantive (noun)". 35 The headline used words for a salutation being stored under the category "Letter Start". Then were five sentences generated with the structures described above. The scheme"Yours—Adverb—MUC" (MUC = Manchester University Computer) was used for the last line of the letter. The results of these computing processes were printed without commas by a teleprinter.

 Christopher Strachey: Love-letters 1952

 Link, David: Ferranti Mark I Emulator with Christopher Strachey's "Love-letters" (1952; Link: Angel 2006, p.16, fig.1).

 Strachey divided his program in a random generator, a selection of stored elements and a syntax for combinations. With this structure and with the printer output as the form of presentation Strachey anticipated the foundations of computer literature and computer graphics of the sixties.

 Because Strachey's program for the generation of sentences did not care about semantic fields changing from sentence to sentence the generated "Love Letters" could include semantic deviations to usual love letters. These deviations could be understood as comments to the contemporary 'language of love' and its gender norms: Were Strachey's "Love Letters" not rather a programmed non-conformity than an unsuccessful trial to generate love messages with the goal to fake human authors? 36

 In 1959 Theo Lutz produced "stochastic texts" at the Rechen-Institut of the Technische Hochschule in Stuttgart. At this time Lutz was a degree candidate of Max Bense. He proposed to Lutz to install "a database with 100 words from Franz Kafka's novel 'The Castle' and simple sentence structures" 37 in his text generating program. Lutz picked up this proposal in his selection of words for the database of his program written in ALGOL. The program was installed on a valve computer Zuse Z 22 (1958) to select words from the database and to generate syntactically correct sentences.

 Theo Lutz: Stochastischer Text 1959

 Lutz, Theo: Stochastic Text, 1959. Zuse Z22, teleprinter's output.

 The database divides the stored words in 16 subjects and 16 predicates. The program combined selections of one subject and one predicate with selections of one of four "logical constants" ("und", "oder", "so gilt", "." ["and, "or", "if...then", "."]) and one of four "logical operators" for a subject's existence ("ein", "jeder", "kein", "nicht jeder" ["one", "each", "no one" and "not each"] in feminine, masculine and factual German forms). The frequencies of the subjects and the predicates as well as of the logical constants and logical operators were determined to be the same. Only the "relative frequency" of the point (the sign for the negation of a combination between words) was fixed at a higher rate then the other logical constants.

 While Max Bense integrates the semantic terms "true" and "false" in his cybernetically based information theory 38, Lutz does not take into account questions of truth because his program generates sentences like "Jeder Fremde ist nah, so gilt kein Fremder ist alt" 39 ("[Because] each stranger is near [so] it is valid [that] no stranger is old"), although this conclusion is false in the light of our knowledge of the world. Lutz's "stochastic texts" effect an "aesthetic information" as it was defined in 1960 by Max Bense in "Aesthetica".

 In the computer literature's combinations of words the "aesthetic information" provokes tensions with "semantic information". 40 While readers of generated texts are confronted with the truth criteria of "semantic information" even if the programming does not care about them, computer graphics (see below) substitute the problem by the task how to direct visual perception by the programming of graphical signs and their distribution on a plane.

 

 Computer Graphics

 In the sixties A. Michael Noll (since 1962), Frieder Nake (since 1963/64) and Georg Nees (since 1964) created computer graphics in programming mainframe computers 41 with FORTRAN and ALGOL. Because of these higher programming languages for the then relatively recent compilers it was no longer necessary to write programs in machine language. Christopher Strachey, Theo Lutz and other authors used the following procedures in computer literature before they reoccur in the computer graphics by Noll, Nees and Nake:

     the selection of elements,
     a random generator,
     determinations of the frequencies how often a program can choose elements, and
     a syntax for combinations of these elements.

 Often points and lines were used as elements. The lines were constructed as connections between points. The relations between a programmed distribution of elements on a plane and the optical effects in a total view substituted the readability of text characters combined in lines.

 Planes were structured in zones. In each zone the program is able to restart the same procedure for the selection and combination of elements. The visual overall impression is influenced by the zoning of a plane, the determination of the frequency how often a (pseudo-) random generator can choose the elements for each zone, and the combination possibilities.

 In summer 1962, when A. Michael Noll worked in a department for telephone transmission at the Bell Laboratories (Murray Hill/New Jersey) 42, he programmed "Patterns" in FORTRAN for an IBM 7090 (since 1959). 43 A Stromberg Carlson 4020 Microfilm Plotter presented the "Patterns" on a cathode ray tube. The image on the screen was photographed and the 35 mm negative was "multiplied by photoprinting in different seizes." 44

 Rechts: Pattern Four, 1962, photo print (Noll: Patterns 1962, unpaginated).

 Points were located via random procedures, and lines were constructed as programmed connections between the points. In this way jagged lines were produced – or the combinations were reduced to lines meeting each other at right angles.

 Noll's "polygon moves" ("Polygonzüge") – as they were designated by Frieder Nake 45 – were picked up by Georg Nees in computer graphics illustrated in issue 3/4 of the "Grundlagenstudien aus Kybernetik und Geisteswissenschaften" ("Basic Studies in Cybernetics and Humanities"), published in December 1946. 46 The instructions were written in ALGOL. They controlled a mainframe computer (Siemens 2002, 1959-66) in processing the polygon moves several times next to each other and one below the other: The algorithm starts the polygon moves anew in predetermined zones. 47 The number of lines in each zone is fixed by the program, and a random generator selects the length and the distribution of the consecutive lines before they were printed by a Zuse Z 64 Graphomat.

 Nees, Georg: 23-Ecke, 1964, plotter drawing (Nees: Variationen 1964, p.124, ill.2).

 In a series of computer graphics realised between 1965 and 1968 the program determines how far the "polygon moves" can transgress the zones within which the consecutive lines will be restarted. 48 The transgressing polygon moves interpenetrate each other. In an overall view the polygon moves appear as snarls of lines with variing densities or simply as a confusion of lines 49: The "creation of texture by overlapping" ("Texterzeugung durch Überlappung") 50 – in Nees' words – provokes a "gradation of the type heap – variation – gestalt" ("vom Typus Haufen – Variation – Gestalt"). 51 Nees programmed the computer graphics with regard to the optical resolutions variing in close-up and distant views: "Gestalts are different information units with a local and distal nexus." ("Gestalten sind unterschiedliche Informationseinheiten mit Lokal- und Distalnexus.") 52

 In 1966 Frieder Nake developed the program "walk-through-raster" in "ALGOL60" ("with some assembler-sub-programs"/"mit einigen Assembler-Unterprogrammen", realised with Telefunken TR4 (since 1962) and Zuse Z64 Graphomat) and chose "six modes" in which computing processes proceed step by step across the plane. 53 Furthermore in Nake's procedure to select elements from a repertoire each subsequent range of possibilities depended "from the last chosen sign". As explained by Nake, the program simulated a "short memory". 54 At specified positions for the exchange of elements the program was determinated by "transition probabilities" ("Übergangswahrscheinlichkeiten") in its selection between alternatives. 55 For the "six modes" as ways of a computing process to step across the plane Nake programmed six variants with a "defined repertoire and defined probabilities" (mit "festem Repertoire und festen Wahrscheinlichkeiten"). 56 The sign repertoire of the series "2.1" was constituted by blank fields as well as by vertical and horizontal lines in various lengths. 57 The distribution of these signs of the repertoire on the flat support provokes a shimmering overall view.

 Comparisons with serial works by Richard Paul Lohse, Karl Gerstner, Francois Morellet, Marcello Morandini or Sol LeWitt demonstrate characteristics uncommon to computer graphics: Instead of Serial Art's sequences caused by repeated executions of a mutation rule, the computer graphics of the 'three N's' offer variations joining together to an overall view, in spite of irritating zones – as elements fitting together in a visual structure, but with some disturbances. Serial works provoke sequencing ways to perceive them. In this kind of perception visual impressions and reconstructions of the rules guiding the production of a work can be related to each other step by step, in phases. Unlike this mode of perception computer graphics complying with criteria of information aesthetics provoke beholders to eye movements sliding between the overall view and outstanding details. Nevertheless computer graphics can be distinguished from an abstract art created intuitively like artworks realised among others by members of De Stijl, for example by Piet Mondrian (since 1914) and Theo van Doesburg (since 1917). These artists arranged lines and colour fields in their efforts to achieve an overall view via a visual balance between contrasting elements. Overlappings, accumulations and disturbances were avoided.

 Meanwhile in computer graphics the distribution of signs on a flat support seems to be the result of intuitive decisions it is in fact the result of an interplay between program and chance. This becomes apparent if the relations between repeated combination modes and irregularities are reconstructable as consequences of the program. The program includes a random generator being constituted by algorithms, too. The computed arrangement of signs influences the oscillation of the perception processes between overall view and details.

 The static medium of graphics printed by plotters is a result of a computing process and it provokes perception processes refering back to the computing process as it was controlled by the artist via programming. The programming makes different plotter prints possible: Each print presents one of the program's possibilities meanwhile abstract works guided by the artistic intuition of the members of De Stijl mentioned above don't have such a state of possibilities. In abstract paintings of De Stijl the placement of a sign can't have the same state as in plotter prints: Here the relations between the elements can be as they were printed – or they can be other ones within the range of possible prints being realisable by the program.

 

 Informations Aesthetics

 Max Bense and Abraham André Moles defined the "aesthetic measure" by exploring the best possible relation between the "complexity" of the visual "information" and the "orderliness" ("redundancy") that can be recognised in the process of perceiving the work. Bense determines the aesthetic measure in using George David Birkhoff's definition as 'order divided by complexity' ("Birkhoff's quotient"). 58. In contrary Moles refers to empirical investigations of visual perception in his plea for the 'multiplication of order by complexity'. 59 Shannon's "statistic information" provides the basics for this numerical definition of the aesthetic measure. 60. It presupposes precise knowledge of the number of used elements ("sign repertoire") and the possibilities to combine them. 61

 In addition to the cybernetic term "statistic information" the information theory established a further use of the term information as one side of the conceptual pair information/redundancy: If the probability of one of the possible elements is low then in case of its occurrence the "surprise effect" is larger and the "information content" higher. For the perceptibility of order some elements should occur more often and with higher probability: This reduces the "information content" and hightens the redundancy. Information aesthetics try to find paths between information and redundancy. In this way information aesthetics are a facilitation for artists in their efforts to develop solutions for the coordination of order with complexity from the point of view of an artwork's forms and the coordination of information with redundancy from the point of view of the visual perception.

 As proposed by Bense, in art improbable orders should be realised by the "elemination of the avoidable" ("Ausscheidung des Vermeidbaren)" and the "reduction of redundancy" ("Verringerung der Redundanz"). 62 Meanwhile Bense discusses the criteria to care for the "unavoidable" (das "Unvermeidbare") as a required porperty of works of art, Moles thematises their perception. In Moles' reflections the receiver's "limit of apperception" and its dependency on the observer's previous knowledge are dominant subjects. If the visual complexity is above the "limit of apperception" then there is no order recognisable. For Moles it is a reasonable conclusion to avoid transgressions of this limit. 63

 Thus a certain amout of redundancy is inevitable. In the computer graphics presented above and realised by Nees and Nake in 1965 and 1967 the need for redundancy is fulfilled by the constantly repeated horizontal and vertical lines as well as by a visual perception guided by 'distribution patterns'.

 Max Bense' s differentiation between "micro-" and "macroaesthetics" inspired Georg Nees to program graphics with visual features keeping the beholders' eyes in motion because the distribution patterns are shifting between image areas as well as between close and distant views. 64 Frieder Nake went a step further and integrated "an amount of information aesthetic measurements" ("eine Anzahl informationsästhetischer Messungen") into his "walk-through-raster" program: For the programming and the generation of graphics the visual perception becomes relevant via its information theoretical capture. 65

 Meanwhile Nees and Nake realised programs for their works before they wrote about them in books to give them an information aesthetic context, Herbert Werner Franke wrote in 1967 a book titled "Phänomen Kunst" ("Phenomen Art") about information aesthetics before he realised in 1969 his first digital computer graphics with algebraic curves: the body of works named "KAES". They pose difficulties for the translation from forms of computer graphics to criteria for measurements of order and complexity. Franke's "experimental aesthetics" was at the same time oriented to problems of production as well as of reception, with a domination of the last one. 66

 The first-order cybernetics were geared towards machine processes and for the engineering sciences their researchers developed scientific augmented 'applied mathematics'. From these first-order cybernetics emerged the information aesthetics: They shifted the focus to designs for the human perception. The authors of second-order cybernetics Margaret Mead, Gregory Bateson, Heinz von Foerster, Ernst von Glasersfeld, Gotthard Günther and Humberto Maturana combined their subjects 'cognition' and 'observing systems' to theses on self-observation (or observation of observation, second-order observation). Gordon Pask anticipated with his "learning machines" not only this reorientation but developed his learning models further to a conversation theory thematising the relations between learning processes and symbolic interaction. 67

 Within these changes of the cybernetic research the pioneers of computer art localised themselves with their works and texts. Either they emphasised the possibilities to integrate observers of cybernetic sculptures into circuits, or they oriented their production of computer graphics to cognitive aspects of the visual perception. In contemporary art this division is dropped in favor of a plurality of alternative presentation modes integrating cognitive aspects in different manners.

 Forerunners of the art of the sixties and its exploration of new media were not only Buckminster Fuller and Marshall McLuhan 68, but cybernetics, too. 69 Cybernetics were ignored from an art criticism based on classic humanities (hermeneutics and style analysis). 70 Computer art influenced by cybernetics was exotic 71 – today we recognise in its initiatiors the pioneers creating the fundaments of the development of computer art in the following decades.

 On Shannon' s report of the results of his scientific research for military goals in "A Mathematical Theory of Communication" (Shannon/Weaver: Theory 1949/1998): Roch: Shannon 2009, p.145: "Shannon worked out first the answer for the discrete case of a secure communication in `A Mathematical Theory of Cryptography´ ([Shannon: Theory 1945]), then he prepared the continuous case of a disturbed transmission for `Transmission of Information´ ([manuscript ]1947, [publication: Shannon: Communication 1949]). In 1948 Shannon brought the methods and results of all preparatory works together in `A Mathematical Theory of Communication´ [Shannon/Weaver: Theory 1949/1998]. Shannon problematised not only the question of an effective communication, but concretely the theoretical basics of a secure and effective navigation of electronic air defence systems." (Translation by the author)
 Roch: Shannon 2009, p.104, citing Shannon: "`When I came out with my paper in 1948, part of that was taken verbatim from the cryptography report, which had not been published at that time.´ [Shannon in Price: Conversation 1985, p.170] For the scientific public Shannon simply devided his 114 pages long `cryptography report´ in two parts: one part more about communication theory and another one on codes."

 26 Pask: Comment 1971, p.86.
 Gordon Pask´s "electro-chemical display" is a part of a research investigating the relations between "stability and variety" in "self-organizing systems". In the course of the research Pask began to develop "chemical computers": "Chemical computers arise from the possibility of `growing´ an active evolutionary network by an electro-chemical process." (Pask: Approach 1961, p.105) On the insights in emergence that Pask was able to win within the research project: Cariani: Emergence 1991, p.789; Cariani: Ear 1993; Pickering: Brain 2010, p.334-343; Whitehead: Metacreation 2004, p.223.

 27 Pask: Comment 1971, p.86: "From the performer´s point of view, training becomes a matter of persuading the machine to adopt a visual style which fits the mood of his performance. At this stage in the development of the rapport, the performer conceives the machine as an extension of himself, rather than as a detached or disassociated entity."

 44 Noll: Patterns 1962, p.4 (quote); Patterson: Vision 2015, Ebook mobi position 735.

 45 Nake: Ästhetik 1974, p.199.
 Noll was not inspired by information aesthetics (Klütsch: Computergrafik 2007, p.165s.), but with his "polygon moves" he offered to Georg Nees and Frieder Nake a programming strategy with capacities to be developed further with criteria of information aesthetics.
 The comparison between computer literature and computer graphics demonstrates that the last one takes up programming procedures of the first one. An early and important step to computer literature was offered by Shannon (see above). Thus Noll does not abandon the intersection of cybernetics and the programming of computers.

The quotes are taken from "The Human Use of Human Beings" (Wiener: Use 1950). The exhibits are realised amongst others by Stafford Beer, Gordon Pask, Nicolas Schöffer, Frieder Nake and Georg Nees.
 In 1968 Jack Burnham writes in "Beyond Modern Sculpture" on William Ross Ashby ("Homeostat"), Max Bense, Gotthard Günther, Gordon Pask, Claude Elwood Shannon, William Grey Walter, (Cybernetic Sculptures and) Nicolas Schöffer: Burnham: Sculpture 1968, p.204,334-338,344s. Cf. Burnham: Notes 1970, p.11.
 In 1970 Gene Youngblood writes in "Expanded Cinema": "My indebtedness to the thoughts of R. Buckminster Fuller, John McHale, Norbert Wiener, and Marshall McLuhan is quite clear." (Youngblood: Cinema 1970, p.44, cf. p.62,71 and others).

 70 This is particularly true in the case of the English-language context of the sixties for the art critics of the "modernism" Michael Fried, Clement Greenberg and Rosalind Krauss dominating the public opinion on art.
 In Western Germany the authors of texts about information aesthetics formed a group of its own within the sixties' debates about art (Kurd Alsleben, Max Bense, Helmar Frank, Herbert Werner Franke, Karl Otto Götz, Rul Gunzenhäuser, Siegfried Maser, Günter Otto, Günter Pfeiffer, Hans Ronge). Cf. Ronge: Kunst 1968.

 71 On the evolution of American art from Abstract Expressionism to Pop Art and Minimal Art as a paradigm for the history of Post-war art that should not be prolonged by Conceptual Art because a "paradigm shift-off" seemed necessary: Atkinson/Baldwin: Work 1972, p.167. In this 'paradigm of a sequence of paradigms' installations, performance art, computer art and experimental films were left out: The sequence of paradigms, as it was established by contemporary art criticism and the exhibition circuit (museums and galleries), had an excluding character: The art world (art museums, art market, art criticism, history of art) marginalised the computer art, and with it pushed cybernetics to the peripheries of the art context, too.

Kybernetik, Computer und Kunst

Kybernetik und Computertechnologie kreuzten sich in ihrer Entwicklung bereits im Zweiten Weltkrieg. In den Anfangsjahren der Kybernetik schlugen ihre Vertreter Lösungen vor, wie sich mittels mathematischer Regeln und Schaltplänen Informationsprozesse lenken lassen, und lieferten Grundlagen zur Entwicklung analoger und digitaler Techniken. Kybernetik entstand, um neue Wege der Anwendung von Mathematik zur Lösung von technischen Aufgaben zu finden, und entwickelte sich zu einer generalisierenden Wissenschaft.

Als Norbert Wiener im Sommer 1947 über einen Titel für ein Buch nachdachte, das er vorbereitete, entschied er sich für den griechischen Begriff "kybernetes", den Steuermann: Indem er die Bewegungen des Schiffes im Wasser kontrolliert, kommuniziert der Steuermann zugleich mit dem Schiff und seiner Umgebung. "Cybernetics Or Control And Communication In The Animal And The Machine" hieß das Buch, als es 1948 erschien: Der Titel zeigt, dass es um Eigenschaften von Maschinen und Lebewesen geht. Wieners Begriff "Kybernetik" für ein neues Forschungsfeld hat sich durchgesetzt.

Wieners Vorbild für das kybernetische Interesse am Rechnen als "calculus of reasoning" war Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. Er entwickelte 1703 eine mathematische Universalsprache – die binäre Zahlencodierung – und von 1672 bis 1720 Rechenmaschinen. Leibniz, der daran interessiert war, Denkprozesse, wo immer möglich, durch Technik zu erleichtern, lieferte dafür das Verfahren: Durch Formalisierung wird Rechnen als mechanisierbarer Prozess möglich. 1 Wiener liefert mit seiner Referenz auf Leibniz eine Gelegenheit, die Kybernetik in einer hannoverschen Veranstaltungsreihe aus Anlass des 300. Todestages des Philosophen und Mathematikers vorzustellen.

Pioniere der Computerkunst waren in den fünfziger und sechziger Jahren entweder an der Entwicklung der Kybernetik beteiligt (wie Gordon Pask), oder sie wurden von ihr beeinflusst (wie Nicolas Schöffer, Georg Nees, Frieder Nake und Herbert Werner Franke).

Die Entwicklung der Grundlagen der Kybernetik im 2. Weltkrieg

Die Grundlagen der Kybernetik werden 1948 in zwei Schriften formuliert. Beide informieren über die Forschung, aus der sie hervorgingen: Norbert Wiener erwähnt in "Cybernetics Or Control And Communication In The Animal And The Machine" die Kriegsforschung der Vereinigten Staaten von Amerika, und Claude Elwood Shannon integriert in "A Mathematical Theory of Communication" Berichte über Resultate dieser Forschung. 2 Mit den Beiträgen von Wiener und Shannon zur Vorhersage der Flugbahn in Feuerleitsystemen wurde die amerikanische Forschung für die Fliegerabwehr zum Initiator der Kybernetik.

Während des Zweiten Weltkrieges wurden Rechenkapazitäten neben der Fliegerabwehr auch in der Kryptografie benötigt, für die Computer entwickelt wurden. Durch die computergestützte Kryptografie wurde der Code der deutschen Enigma Maschine entziffert.

Die Wahrscheinlichkeitstheorie ist in Vorhersagen anwendbar, wenn die Möglichkeiten eines Systems und die statistische Häufigkeit des bisherigen Vorkommens dieser Möglichkeiten bekannt sind. Die Wahrscheinlichkeitstheorie wurde grundlegend in der Kryptografie sowie in Wieners und Shannons Forschung zur Vorhersage der Flugbahn, die ein Pilot im Anflug auf ein Ziel wählt. Feuerleitsysteme und Kryptographie wurden neue Anwendungsbereiche der Mathematik. 3

Ballistik II. WK

Ballistik im Zweiten Weltkrieg: Der bei sich bewegenden Zielen notwendige Vorhalt (Gustin: WWII 1998-99).

Ein Feuerleitsystem erhält als Input Daten über ein sich bewegendes Ziel und liefert als Output die Steuerung eines Geschosses auf das Ziel, das sich während der Datenaufnahme und des Prozesses, in dem die Zielbewegung vorherbestimmt wird, weiter bewegt. Das System muss über Rechenprozesse mögliche Bewegungen des Ziels so bestimmen, dass das reale Ziel mit hoher Wahrscheinlichkeit getroffen wird. Die Rechner in Feuerleitsystemen des Zweiten Weltkrieges wurden bereits als Computer bezeichnet.

Im Schaltkreis des Feuerleitsystems hatte der "negative Feedback" eine wichtige Funktion bei der Steuerung von Informationen. Große Abweichungen, die durch fehlerhaften Input bei der Verfolgung des Zieles entstanden, wurden via Filter aussortiert. Die diesem "negativen Feedback" unterworfenen Daten konnten nach der Filterung und Datenglättung keinen Output erzeugen, wenn sie – wegen fehlerhafter Eingaben oder Störungen – von einer kontinuierlichen Flugbahn des Ziels abwichen. 4

negative feedback

Negativer Feedback (Apter: Cybernetics 1969, S.259).

Norbert Wiener hatte seit 1940 5 den Auftrag, die Möglichkeiten zu verbessern, die Flugbahn eines feindlichen Flugobjekts vorherzusagen. Durch eine präzisere Vorhersage sollte die Trefferquote der Fliegerabwehr der Allierten im Luftkampf um England erhöht werden. Wiener teilte die Bewegung eines fliegenden Objektes in Zeitphasen. So liessen sich zwischen den Phasen auftretende Wiederholungen oder Modifikationen erkennen. 6

Wiener fütterte sein Vorhersagesystem mit Daten von Flugobjekten verfolgenden Soldaten. Versuchspersonen lieferten diese Daten einem Testmodell – dem von Julian Bigelow und Paul Mooney gebauten "antiaircraft predictor". 7 Wieners Anwendung von Wahrscheinlichkeit und Statistik überführte Shannon mittels Stochastik durch "meßbare Übergangswahrscheinlichkeiten" in eine Analyse von Phasenbeziehungen in der Zeitdimension. 8

C. (Galison: Ontology 1994, S.239).

Wieners "theoretisches Modell" 9 für Kommandogeräte von Flakgeschützen behandelt Angreifer und Verfolger beziehungsweise Pilot und Richtschütze als Bestandteile eines Systems. Indem Piloten und ihre Spur verfolgende Richtschützen auf systemrelevante Eigenschaften reduziert werden, wird eine Ebene geschaffen, auf der zwischen Mensch und Maschine nicht unterschieden wird. Norbert Wiener resümiert 1956:

    Deshalb muß man, um zu einer möglichst vollkommenen mathematischen Behandlung des gesamten Steuerungsproblems zu gelangen, die verschiedenen Teile eines Systems einer einzigen Grundlage, sei es eine menschliche oder eine mechanische, angleichen...[wir] versuchten...eine mechanische Entsprechung für den Richtschützen und den Piloten zu finden. 10

Als die Flugzeuge im Laufe des 2. Weltkrieges immer schneller und wendiger wurden, wurde das Verhalten der Piloten immer schwieriger vorhersagbar. 11 Als Antwort auf dieses Problem entwickelte eine Forschergruppe der Bell Laboratories, an der Shannon beteiligt war, im Projekt "Nike-Ajax" ein System zur ständigen Korrektur der Flugbahn eines Geschosses. Das System war 1953 einsatzfähig 12: Die automatisierte Rückkoppelung der Richtungsänderungen eines Zieles an das Geschoss war die Antwort auf Kursänderungen der Piloten.

Nike Ajax Kommunikationsdiagramm

Kommunikationsdiagramm Nike, 1945 (Roch: Shannon 2009, S.159).

Für die Verfolgung des Zieles konnte ab 1937 Radar eingesetzt werden: Die Fehlmessungen wurden so reduziert. In "Nike-Ajax" wurde die Zielverfolgung mittels Radar in das Feedback-System einer Missile integiert, die auf neue Messungen im Prozess des Fluges mit Richtungsänderungen reagiert. 13

 

Kybernetische Modelle

Die nach dem Krieg von Kybernetikern entwickelten "materiellen Modelle" zur Wegfindung von Maschinen (s.u.) wenden die Zielsuche der Flakfeuerleitung in zivile Aufgaben.

Eine als Regel formulierte Hypothese eines "theoretischen Modells" und sie belegende Prozesse in einem "materiellen Modell" ergänzten sich in einigen Forschungsprojekten wechselseitig. 14 An diese kybernetischen Modelle schlossen von Computern gesteuerte kybernetische Skulpturen (s.u.) an.

Das "materielle Modell" lieferte gebautes Anschauungsmaterial für im "theoretischen Modell" formulierte Zusammenhänge, die auch in Systemen mit anderen Elementen vorkommen: So wurden Hypothesen über für Lebewesen zentrale Prozesse mit maschinellen Elementen rekonstruiert.

William Ross Ashby konstruierte 1946/47 ein Modell als funktionierendes Beispiel für seine Theorie der "Homöostase". Nach Ashby können Systeme auf Umwelt besser reagieren, wenn sie intern auf Veränderungen, die durch externe Einwirkung in einem ihrer Teile verursacht wurden, durch Ausgleichsbewegungen zwischen dem direkt betroffenen und anderen Teilen reagieren.

William Ross Ashby: Design for a Brain 1952/1960, S.101

Ashby, William Ross: Homeostat, 1946-47 (Ashby: Design 1952/1960, S.101).

Das vierteilige technische System "Homeostat" demonstrierte Ashbys systemübergreifendes "law of requisite variety". Regler an jeder der vier Einheiten ermöglichten es, durch Einstellungsveränderungen das intern auf Spannungsschwankungen reagierende System zu Ausgleichsbewegungen zu provozieren: Eine für eine Einheit zu starke Störung wurde an die nächsten Einheiten weiter geleitet. Die Ausschläge jeder Einheit zeigten Nadeln, die in einer leitenden Flüssigkeit lagen. 15

William Ross Ashby: Desing for a Brain 1952/1960, S.102

Ashby, William Ross: Homeostat, Schaltplan (Ashby: Design 1952/1960, S.102).

Durch seine mehrteilige Binnendifferenzierung konnte das System auf Umweltstörungen selbstregulierend reagieren und so seine Reaktionsfähigkeit erhöhen. Im stabilen Gesamtzustand befanden sich alle Teile entweder in einer Mittellage oder in entgegengesetzten Grenzzuständen, die sich wechselseitig ausglichen.

Claude Elwood Shannon konstruierte 1950 eine "Maze Solving Machine" 16, deren "sensing finger" sich bereits gegangene Wege merkte und zu denen er zurückkehrte, nachdem eine Sackgasse des Labyrinths beschritten wurde: Wegsuche mit maschinellem Gedächtnis. 17

Shannon: Maze-Solving Machine 1951

Shannon, Claude Elwood: Maze-Solving Machine, Plan (Shannon: Presentation 1951/2003, S.174, Figure 8).

William Grey Walter entwickelte 1948 und 1951 bewegliche "materielle Modelle", die mit Sensoren für Ton, Licht und Berührungen ausgestattet waren. Zwischen Hindernissen fanden die Roboter Wege zu einer Garage mit Stromversorgung. Die 1951 gebaute "CORA" konnte sich die Hindernisse merken. 18

Walter, William Grey: Elmer, 1948.

1953 verglich Walter in seinem Buch "The Living Brain" CORAs "electrical oscillation at low frequency" mit seinen Messungen von Gehirnströmen mittels Electroencephalogramm. Die Messungen ließen erkennen, ob ein Ereignis vergessen oder gemerkt und verarbeitet wurde. Walter verstand seine sich orientierenden Roboter als maschinelles Äquivalent zu Gehirnaktivitäten. 19

Die vorgestellten "materiellen Modelle" stehen für die kybernetischen Themen Selbstregulierung (Ashby) sowie Wegfindung und Gedächtnis (Shannon, Wiener). Diese Themen wurden vor dem Horizont der Entwicklung zeitgenössischer maschineller und elektronischer Technologien diskutiert, und die Gültigkeit von Hypothesen in biologischen Systemen wurde geprüft.

Für die mit der Vorhersage für Flakfeuerleitgeräte im 2. Weltkrieg entstandene Kybernetik hat Wiener seit Kriegsende – unter dem Eindruck des Atombombenabwurfs auf Hiroshima und Nagasaki (1945) 20 – zivile Aufgaben vorgestellt, darunter Zusammenhänge zwischen Homeostase und Anthropologie sowie Medizin. 21 Ashby und Walter hatten an der Neuorientierung ebenfalls ihren Anteil, während Shannon in den Bell Laboratories an neuen Waffensystemen arbeitete: Die Selbstorientierung seiner "Maze Solving Machine" und die Selbststeuerung der Missiles im "Nike Ajax"-Projekt sind zivile und militärische Varianten desselben Problemfeldes.

 

Kybernetische Skulpturen

Die kybernetischen Modelle (s.o.) enthielten für Nicolas Schöffer Anregungen für kybernetische Skulpturen (s.u.). Vor Schöffer jedoch schuf Gordon Pask, Erfinder und Autor vieler Beiträge zur Kybernetik 22, das erste Werk der Computerkunst.

Pask stellt in "An Approach to Cybernetics" (1961) "`learning´ machines" vor, darunter auch "Eucrates". Pask rekonstruiert 1955 die verzögerte menschliche Aufnahmefähigkeit von neuem Input durch eine maschinelle Lernschwelle: Nachdem die Schwelle für die Aufnahme weiterer Informationen nach Input gestiegen ist, fällt dieses Hindernis langsam. Kommt neuer Input zu spät, zeigt das System fehlenden Input an, indem es aktiv wird. 23

Gordon Pask: Eucrates ca. 1956

Pask, Gordon: Solartron EUCRATES II, ca. 1956 (Pask: Approach 1961, pl.I 8(i)).

Pask variiert das Prinzip von "learning machines" wie "Eucrates" in dem zwischen 1953 und 1957 mit Robin McKinnon-Wood entwickelten reaktiven System "Musicolour" für Bühnen: Ein Musiker wird, wenn sein Input in ein Mikrofon nachlässt, von visuellem Output zu weiteren Klangproduktionen angeregt. So kann der Musiker über den audiellen Input die audio-visuellen Zusammenhänge während einer Aufführung beeinflussen.

Rechts: Moon-Music, Programmheft (Rosen: Control 2008, S.139).

Der in "Musicolour" integrierte, von Pask und McKinnon-Wood konstruierte Analogrechner 24 enthielt Klangfilter, Speichereinheiten und Elemente zur weiteren Verarbeitung des Klanginputs. Die vom Rechner transformierten Daten führten zu einem Output, das mit Lichtprojektionen auf eine Projektionsfläche gelenkt wird. Das Licht wiederum wurde von Farb- und Musterfiltern modifiziert 25, denen in einer späteren Entwicklungsphase des Projektes durch ein elektrochemisches System weitere Möglichkeiten zu Veränderungen der Lichtprojektionen hinzugefügt wurden. 26

Gordon Pask: Musicolour system 1954

Pask, Gordon: Musicolour, 1953-57, Schaltplan (Pask: Comment 1971, S.79, Fig. 26).

Pask beschrieb Musiker und Maschine als Teile eines "learning mechanism", in dem beide Seiten sich wechselseitig anpassten, was eine Lernfähigkeit auch des maschinellen Teils voraussetzte. 27 "Musicolour" war ein "responsive environment" 28, das sich in umfassendere Aufführungssysteme integrieren liess. Das Environment war eine Herausforderung, für das System ungewöhnliche Aufführungsformen zu entwickeln.

Pask transformierte Reaktionsmöglichkeiten, wie sie in Maschinen und Menschen umfassenden Systemen im Zweiten Weltkrieg (s.o.) entwickelt wurden, und die "materiellen Modelle" der Kybernetik zu "learning machines", die an Beispielen vorführen, wie sich Kognition durch maschinelle Unterstützung fördern lässt.

Nicolas Schöffer konstruiert "CYSP 1" 1956 als mobile kinetische Skulptur. Während der Sockel auf Gummirädern selbststeuernd Wege durch Ausstellungs- und Aufführungsräume sucht, drehen sich Aluminiumscheiben auf einem Stahlgerüst. Die Bewegungen des Sockels und der Aluminiumscheiben koordiniert ein in den Sockel integriertes "Elektronenhirn" («cerveau électronique») mit Röhrentechnik. Als Sensoren zur Registrierung von Veränderungen der Farben, der Lichtintensität und der Lautstärke in der Umwelt wurden photoelektrische Zellen und ein Mikrophon eingebaut.

Schöffer, Nicolas: CYSP 1, 1956. Links: Ausstellung Institute of Contemporary Arts, London 1960 (Das bei einer Vorführung im Ausstellungsraum von der rechten Person benutzte Steuergerät entfiel im Normalbetrieb).

Mit Ashbys "Homeostat" (s.o.) teilt "CYSP 1" die Eigenbewegung des Systems mittels Zufallsgenerator und eine begrenzte Adaptionsfähigkeit an Umweltbedingungen. Nicolas Schöffer und Jacques Bureau, der Entwickler des "Elektronengehirns" für "CYSP 1", greifen auf Ashbys Begriffe "Homeostase" und "Homeostat" zurück, wenn sie die Funktionen von kybernetischen Skulpturen wie "CYSP 1" erklären. 29 In "CYSP 1" werden die Regler des "Homeostat" durch Sensoren ersetzt, und die im "Homeostat" interne Ausbalancierung der Störungen ersetzt ein die Umwelteinflüsse verarbeitender Rechner. Auf die Selbststeuerung von William Grey Walters Robotern (s.o.) folgt in "CYSP 1" eine Selbststeuerung mittels Elektronik. Mit der Skulptur als selbst steuernd fahrende Op Art überführt Schöffer kybernetische Modelle in kybernetische Skulpturen.

Mit der Bewegung der Aluminiumscheiben avanciert "CYSP 1" zu einem frühen Beispiel der kinetischen Variante der Op Art, die durch Abraham André Moles zum Untersuchungsfeld der Informationsästhetik wird. Moles unterwirft die Untersuchung ästhetischer Aspekte naturwissenschaftlichen Methoden (s.u.).

Gordon Pasks reaktive Installation "Colloquy of Mobiles" (1968) bestand aus einer von der Decke abgehängten dreieckigen Platte mit stumpfen Ecken, an der drei sich drehende, organisch geformte und von innen beleuchtete Fiberglaskörper hingen. Zwei Mobiles aus anorganisch geformten Teilen waren an einem längsrechteckigen Element befestigt, das sich unter der dreieckigen Platte drehte. Die Mobiles bezeichnete Pask als "Males" und die Fiberglaskörper als "Females".

Pask, Gordon: Colloquy of Mobiles, 1968, Ausstellung "Cybernetic Serendipity", ICA London 1968 (rechts hinten: Schöffer, Nicolas: CYSP 1, 1956).

Die "Males" und "Females" wurden durch Elektromotoren um vertikale Achsen gedreht. Diese Motoren steuerte ein an einer Wand stehender Computer, der von Mark Dowson, Gordon Pask und Tony Watts konstruiert worden war. An der Decke befestigte Kabel verbanden den Computer mit der Installation.

Pask, Gordon: Colloquy of Mobiles, 1968, Ausstellung "Cybernetic Serendipity", ICA London 1968 (Pask: Comment 1971, S.97, Fig.40).

In die "Males" waren Fotozellen und Elemente eingebaut, mit denen Licht auf Spiegel, die in Öffnungen der "Females" montiert waren, geschickt werden konnte. Das von den Spiegeln der "Females" reflektierte Licht wiederum konnten die Fotozellen der "Males" registrieren. Die sich drehenden Elemente waren in ihren Reaktionen aufeinander memorier- und lernfähig. Das komplexe Reiz-Reaktions-System, das Änderungen des Rotationstempos und der Lichtfarben steuerte, konnten Zuschauer durch Interventionen mit Taschenlampen verändern: Dann sendeten sie wie die "Males" Licht auf die Spiegel in den "Females".

Pask, Gordon: Colloquy of Mobiles, 1968, Grund- und Aufriss der mobilen Elemente (Pask: Comment 1971, S.90, Fig.34).

Pask liefert nach Ashbys "Homeostat" mit "Colloquy of Mobiles" ein weiteres Modell für dessen "law of requisite variety" (s.o.). Das System "Homeostat" aus Subsystemen, die sich wechselseitig als Umwelt wahrnehmen, greift Pask in "Colloquy of Mobiles" mit den aufeinander reagierenden kinetischen Elementen auf. Aus der Art, wie Pask den "Homeostat" um Gedächtnis- und Lernfähigkeit erweitert, und wie die kinetischen Elemente miteinander kommunizieren, ergeben sich die Möglichkeiten für Zuschauerinterventionen: Die Möglichkeiten des Systems, auf Außeneinwirkung zu reagieren, sind die Folge der Ausdifferenzierung des Systems in interne Relationen zwischen Teilen. Diese System/Umwelt-Relation bestätigt Ashby´s "law of requisite variety". 30

 

Computerliteratur

Das zukünftige Vorkommen einer in der Vergangenheit häufig festgestellten Elementkombination ist wahrscheinlicher als das einer selten eingetretenen Kombination. Zuerst die Computerliteratur und dann die Computergrafik nutzten die durch Häufigkeitskriterien begrenzbaren Möglichkeiten, um dann per Zufallsverfahren eine Möglichkeit zu wählen.

Claude Elwood Shannon schlägt in der 1948 publizierten "A Mathematical Theory of Communication" vor, die Wahrscheinlichkeitstheorie und Statistik kombinierende Stochastik zur Generierung von Worten einzusetzen. Eine Statistik mit Daten, wie häufig bestimmte Kombinationen von zwei und drei Buchstaben in englischen Worten vorkommen, dient als Grundlage zur Generierung von Worten aus Buchstabenkombinationen. Aus durch die Statistik eingeschränkten Möglichkeiten, welche Buchstaben auf andere folgen, wählt ein Computer per Pseudo-Zufallsverfahren Möglichkeiten aus, um Worten vergleichbare Buchstabenfolgen zu generieren. Shannon schlug vor, auf die gleiche Weise Sätze aus einem Archiv englische Worte zu kombinieren: eine nur statistischen Wahrscheinlichkeiten folgende Wortkombination. Mit wiederholt einsetzbaren statistischen Kriterien der Wahl aus Kombinationsmöglichkeiten versuchte Shannon zu zeigen, dass "the resemblance to ordinary English text increases quite noticeably". 31

Shannons Methode zur Generierung von Kunstsprachen ist eine Variante eines Verfahrens der Kryptografie, in der es zur Entschlüsselung von Codes eingesetzt wird: Eine verschlüsselte Botschaft wird mit Häufigkeitsmerkmalen von Zeichenkombinationen in der Sprache verglichen, in der die Botschaft geschrieben wurde. 32

Die Ähnlichkeit einer mit Shannons Methode generierten Kunstsprache mit der Alltagssprache – bei gleichzeitig auffallenden Differenzen zu ihr – lieferte Autoren Anregungen für die Generierung von Computerliteratur, an deren Programmierweisen Computergrafik anschloss (s.u.).

Christopher Strachey wurde im Juni 1952 von der britischen National Research and Development Corporation als "Technical Officer" angestellt. Bereits ein Jahr zuvor war er Programmierer eines Dame-Spiels 33 und von Computermusik 34 für britische Mainframe Computer (Großrechner) wie Manchester Mark I (1948-50) und Ferranti Mark 1 (1951).

1952 schrieb er ein Programm zur Generierung von "Love Letters" für einen Ferranti Mark 1. Worte aus Roget´s Thesaurus (einem Lexikon für Synonyme) bildeten ein Archiv, aus dem das Programm mittels Zufallsgenerator wählte. Die Worte sind mit syntaktischen Indices (für Adverbien, Adjektive und Substantive) gespeichert worden und wurden in zwei Satzstrukturen eingesetzt: "My—[Adjektiv]—Substantiv—[Adverb]—Verb —Your—[Adjektiv]—Substantiv" oder "You are my—Adjektiv—Substantiv". 35 Auf eine Anrede, für die unter der Kategorie "Letter Start" Worte archiviert waren, folgten fünf Sätze in den oben aufgeführten Satzschemata. Das Briefende folgte dem Schema "Yours—Adverb—MUC" (MUC = Manchester University Computer). Ein Teleprinter druckte die Resultate dieser Rechenprozesse ohne Kommata.

Christopher Strachey: Love-letters 1952

Link, David: Ferranti Mark I Emulator mit Christopher Stracheys "Love-letters" (1952; Link: Angel 2006, S.16, Fig.1).

Strachey gliederte sein Programm in einen Zufallsgenerator, eine Selektion der gespeicherten Elemente und eine Syntax der Kombination. Mit dieser Gliederung und der Präsentationsform des Drucker-Output nahm Strachey Grundelemente der Computerliteratur und Computergrafik der sechziger Jahre vorweg.

Da Stracheys Programm zur Generierung von Sprache auf die je nach Satz abweichenden Bedeutungsfelder der gewählten Worte nicht achtete, konnten generierte "Love Letters" semantische Abweichungen zu Liebesbriefen aufweisen, die auch als Kommentar zur zeitgenössischen `Sprache der Liebe´ und deren Gender-Normen verstehbar waren: Waren Stracheys "Love Letters" nicht vielmehr programmierte Nicht-Konformität als ein misslungener Versuch einer Generierung von Liebesbotschaften mit dem Ziel, humane Urheber vorzutäuschen? 36

Theo Lutzs "stochastische Texte" entstanden 1959 am Recheninstitut der Technischen Hochschule Stuttgart. Lutz war in dieser Zeit Diplomand bei Max Bense, der ihm die Anregung gab, seinem Programm zur Textgenerierung "ein Repertoire von 100 Wörtern aus Franz Kafkas `Schloß´ sowie einfache Satzstrukturen...vorzugeben." 37 Lutz griff diese Anregung bei der Auswahl von Worten für das Archiv seines in ALGOL geschriebenen Programms auf. Mit einem Röhrenrechner Zuse Z 22 (1958) wurden Worte aus dem Archiv gewählt und grammatisch korrekte Sätze generiert.

Theo Lutz: Stochastischer Text 1959

Lutz, Theo: Stochastischer Text, 1959. Zuse Z22, Fernschreiberausdruck.

Das Archiv teilte den Wortbestand in 16 Subjekte und 16 Prädikate. Das Programm gliederte Sätze, indem es eine Auswahl von je einem Subjekt und einem Prädikat mit einer Wahl von je einem von vier "logischen Konstanten" ("und", "oder", "so gilt", ".") und vier "logische Operatoren" für die Existenz eines Subjektes ("ein", "jeder", "kein" und "nicht jeder" in weiblicher, männlicher und sachlicher Form) verband. Die Häufigkeit der Subjekte und Prädikate sowie der logischen Konstanten und Operatoren sollte in einem generierten Text dieselbe sein – abgesehen von der Häufigkeit des Punktes (der Negation einer Veknüpfung zwischen Worten), die höher als die anderen logischen Konstanten festgelegt wurde.

Während Max Bense die semantischen Begriffe "wahr" und "falsch" in seine kybernetisch begründete Informationstheorie integriert 38, berücksichtigt Lutz die Frage der Wahrheit nicht, da sein Programm Sätze wie "Jeder Fremde ist nah, so gilt kein Fremder ist alt" 39 erzeugt, obwohl diese Schlußfolgerung für unsere Weltkenntnis falsch ist. Lutzs "stochastische Texte" erzeugen "ästhetische Information", die Max Bense 1960 in seinen "Aesthetica" erörtert.

Die "ästhetische Information" provoziert bei Wortkombinationen einsetzender Computerliteratur Spannungen mit "semantischer Information". 40 Während Leser generierter Texte mit den Wahrheitskriterien "semantischer Information" auch dann konfrontiert werden, wenn sie die Programmierung nicht berücksichtigt, wird dieses Problem in Computergrafik (s.u.) durch die Frage ersetzt, wie sich die visuelle Wahrnehmung durch die Programmierung von Konfigurationen grafischer Zeichen auf einer Fläche lenken lässt.

 

Computergrafik

In den sechziger Jahren schufen A. Michael Noll (ab 1962), Frieder Nake (ab 1963/64) und Georg Nees (ab 1964) Computergrafik durch die Programmierung von Mainframe Computern 41 in FORTRAN und ALGOL. Dank dieser höheren Programmiersprachen für die damals relativ neuen Compiler mussten Programme nicht mehr in Maschinensprache geschrieben werden. Noll, Nees und Nake nahmen folgende Verfahren der Computerliteratur auf, die von Christopher Strachey, Theo Lutz und anderen eingesetzt worden sind:

    die Auswahl von Elementen,
    einen Zufallsgenerator,
    Bestimmungen der Häufigkeit, in der das Programm auf Elemente zugreifen kann, und
    eine Syntax der Kombination dieser Elemente.

Als Elemente wurden meist Punkte und Linien verwendet. Die Linien wurden als Verbindungen zwischen Punkten konstruiert. Die Relationen zwischen programmierter Verteilung von Elementen auf einer Fläche und die optischen Effekte der Gesamtansicht ersetzten die Lesbarkeit von Textzeichenkombinationen in Zeilen.

Bei einer Flächengliederung in Zonen kann ein Programm dieselben Prozesse der Wahl und der Kombination von Elementen in jeder Zone neu starten. Die Flächengliederung, die Begrenzung der Häufigkeit, in der ein (Pseudo-)Zufallsgenerator in einer der Zonen Elemente wählen kann, und die Kombinationsmöglichkeiten beeinflussen den visuellen Gesamteindruck.

A. Michael Noll arbeitete in einer Abteilung für Telefonübertragung der Bell Laboratories (Murray Hill/New Jersey) 42, als er im Sommer 1962 in FORTRAN programmierte "Patterns" von einem IBM 7090 (ab 1959) ausführen liess. 43 Die "Patterns" erschienen auf der Kathodenstrahlröhre eines Stromberg Carlson 4020 Microfilm Plotters. Der Bildschirm wurde abfotografiert und das 35 mm Negativ "im Fotodruckverfahren in unterschiedlichen Größen vervielfältigt." 44

Punkte wurden mittels Zufallsverfahren plaziert und Linien durch programmierte Verbindungen zwischen den Punkten erzeugt. So entstanden gezackte Linien – oder die Kombination wurde auf sich im rechten Winkel treffende Linien eingeschränkt.

Georg Nees griff Nolls "Polygonzüge" – wie sie Frieder Nake nannte 45 – in Computergrafiken auf, die im Dezember 1964 in Heft 3/4 der "Grundlagenstudien aus Kybernetik und Geisteswissenschaften" abgebildet wurden. 46 Das in ALGOL geschriebene Programm kontrollierte einen Großrechner (Siemens 2002, 1959-66) bei der Konstruktion von Polygonzügen, die im Ausdruck durch einen Zuse Z 64 Graphomat neben- und untereinander erschienen: Der Algorithmus startet Polygonzüge in vorgegebenen Feldern neu. 47 Die Anzahl der Linien pro Feld ist vom Programm festgelegt, während die Wahl der Länge und die Verteilung der aufeinander folgenden Linien per Zufallsgenerator erfolgt.

Nees, Georg: 23-Ecke, 1964, Plotterzeichnung (Nees: Variationen 1964, S.124, Bild 2).

In einer 1965-68 realisierten Serie von Computergrafiken legt das Programm fest, wie weit die Linien die Felder, in denen ein Polygonzug neu gestartet wird, überschreiten dürfen. 48 Linien, die verschiedene Felder überschreiten, überschneiden sich. In der Gesamtansicht erscheinen die Polygonzüge optisch als Häufungen von Linien mit variierender Dichte, oder einfach als komplexes Liniengewirr 49: Durch die – in Nees´ Worten – "Texterzeugung durch Überlappung" 50 entsteht optisch eine "Gradation vom Typus Haufen – Variation – Gestalt". 51 Nees plant die unterschiedlichen optischen Auflösungen ein, die sich in Nah- und Fernsicht ergeben: "Gestalten sind unterschiedliche Informationseinheiten mit Lokal- und Distalnexus." 52

Frieder Nake wählte für sein Programm "walk-through-raster", das er 1966 in "ALGOL60" schrieb ("mit einigen Assembler-Unterprogrammen", realisiert mit Telefunken TR4 (ab 1962) und Zuse Z64 Graphomat), "sechs Modi", in denen das Programm eine in Rechtecke unterteilte Fläche nacheinander bearbeiten konnte. 53 Außerdem wählte Nake ein Verfahren der Auswahl aus einem Repertoire von Elementen, in dem die jeweils folgenden Wahlmöglichkeiten "vom zuletzt gewählten Zeichen" abhingen. Dies interpretierte Nake als Simulation eines "kurzen Gedächtnis[ses]". 54 Das Programm folgte beim Wechsel von Zeichen "Übergangswahrscheinlichkeiten", um zwischen Alternativen wählen zu können. 55 Für die "sechs Modi", in denen in einem Rechenprozess die Fläche bearbeitet werden kann, programmierte Nake sechs Varianten mit "festem Repertoire und festen Wahrscheinlichkeiten". 56 In der Serie "2.1" (1966) bestand das Zeichenrepertoire aus leeren Feldern sowie aus langen vertikalen und kurzen horizontalen Strichen verschiedener Länge. 57 Die Verteilung dieser Zeichen des Repertoires in der Fläche provoziert einen flirrenden Gesamteindruck.

Vergleiche mit seriellen Werken von Richard Paul Lohse, Karl Gerstner, Francois Morellet, Marcello Morandini oder Sol LeWitt zeigen, was Computergrafik von Noll, Nees und Nake nicht ist: Statt der Sequenzen der Seriellen Kunst, die durch wiederholte Ausführungen einer Veränderungsregel zustande kommen, bieten Computergrafiken der `drei N´ Variationen, die sich trotz irritierender Zonen zu einem Gesamteindruck fügen – als Elemente einer visuellen Struktur mit Störungen. Serielle Werke dagegen provozieren sequenzierende Beobachtungsweisen, in der visuelle Eindrücke und Regelrekonstruktionen phasenweise von einem Bildteil zum nächsten aufeinander bezogen werden. Im Unterschied zu dieser Beobachtungsweise provozieren Computergrafiken, die informationsästhetischen Kriterien entsprechen, Betrachter zu Blickbewegungen, die zwischen der Gesamtansicht und auffallenden Details gleiten. Gleichwohl lassen sich die Computergrafiken von intuitiv erstellter abstrakter Kunst unterscheiden, wie sie unter Anderen De Stijl-Mitglieder wie Piet Mondrian (ab 1914) und Theo van Doesburg (ab 1917) ausführten. Mondrian und Van Doesburg ordneten Linien und Farbfelder häufig so an, dass sich in der Gesamtansicht eine optischen Balance zwischen kontrastierenden Elementen ergab. Überschneidungen, Häufungen und Störungen wurden vermieden.

Die bei Computergrafiken scheinbar in intuitiven Entscheidungen getroffenen Verteilungen von Elementen auf einer Fläche verdanken sich einem Zusammenspiel von Programm und Zufall. Dies wird erkennbar, wenn die Relation von wiederkehrenden Kombinationsweisen und Irregularitäten als Folge des auch den Zufall durch Algorithmen ausführenden Programms rekonstruierbar ist. Die errechnete Verteilung von Elementen beeinflusst die zwischen Gesamtansicht und Details oszillierenden Wahrnehmungsprozesse.

Das statische Medium der Plottergrafik ist Resultat eines Rechenprozesses und provoziert Wahrnehmungsprozesse, die auf den Rechenprozess zurück verweisen, der via Programmierung von Künstlern gesteuert wird. Die Programmierung ermöglicht verschiedene Plotterdrucke: Jeder Druck zeigt eine der mit der Programmierung möglichen Resultate, während intuitiv erstellte abstrakte Werke der genannten De Stijl-Künstler diesen Möglichkeitsstatus nicht besitzen. Die Situierung eines Elementes kann hier nicht so wie in einem vorliegenden Werk oder auch anders sein.

 

Informationsästhetik

Max Bense und Abraham André Moles bestimmten das "ästhetische Maß" über die für Rezipienten bestmögliche Relation zwischen "Komplexität" der wahrnehmbaren "Information" und der dabei zu entdeckenden "Ordnung" ("Redundanz"). Während Bense das ästhetische Maß, wie vor ihm George David Birkhoff, als Ordnung dividiert durch Komplexität ("Birkhoffscher Quotient") definiert 58, bestimmt Moles das Maß durch die Multiplikation von Ordnung und Komplexität: Moles sieht sich in seiner Auffassung von empirischen Untersuchungen bestätigt. 59 Grundlage dieser numerischen Bestimmungen des ästhetischen Maßes ist Shannons "statistische Information" 60, die exaktes Wissen über die Anzahl von Elementen ("Zeichenrepertoire") und ihre Kombinationsmöglichkeiten voraussetzt. 61

Neben dem kybernetischen Begriff "statistische Information" hat sich in der Informationstheorie ein weiterer Gebrauch des Begriffs Information als eine Seite des Begriffspaars Information/Redundanz etabliert: Ist die Wahrscheinlichkeit des Vorkommens eines Elementes gering, dann ist der "Überraschungseffekt" größer und der "Informationsgehalt" höher. Um Ordnung erkennen zu können, müssen Elemente öfter, also mit höherer Wahrscheinlichkeit auftreten: Das vermindert den "Informationsgehalt" und erhöht die Redundanz. Zwischen Information und Redundanz sucht die Informationsästhetik Wege. Sie erleichtert es Künstlern, in Entwurfsprozessen Lösungen zu finden, wie werkseitig Ordnung mit Komplexität und rezeptionsseitig Information mit Redundanz koordiniert werden können.

Bense erwartet von der Kunst unwahrscheinliche Ordnungen durch die "Ausscheidung des Vermeidbaren" und die "Verringerung der Redundanz". 62 Während Bense das mit diesen Kriterien herauszuarbeitende "Unvermeidbare" als geforderte Eigenschaft von Kunstwerken erörtert, thematisiert Moles ihre Wahrnehmung. Die "Apperzeptionsgrenze" des Betrachters und ihre Abhängigkeit von seiner Vorkenntnis stehen im Zentrum von Moles´ Überlegungen. Über der "Apperzeptionsgrenze" können Rezipienten in visueller Vielfalt keine Ordnung mehr erkennen, weshalb diese Grenze nicht überschritten werden soll. 63

Ein gewisses Maß an Redundanz bleibt also unabdingbar. In den oben vorgestellten Computergrafiken, die Nees und Nake 1965 und 1967 ausführten, sichern konstant wiederkehrende horizontale und vertikale Linien sowie sich in der Wahrnehmung einstellende `Verteilungsmuster´ die nötige Redundanz.

Als Georg Nees sich von Max Benses Unterscheidung zwischen "Mikro-" und "Makroästhetik" anregen ließ, richtete er seine Programme auf Resultate mit visuellen Eigenschaften aus, die das Auge in Bewegung halten, weil sich Verteilungsmuster zwischen den Bildbereichen sowie zwischen Fern- und Nahsicht verschieben. 64 Frieder Nake ging einen Schritt weiter und integrierte in sein "walk-through-raster"-Programm "eine Anzahl informationsästhetischer Messungen": Die visuelle Wahrnehmung wird über ihre informationstheoretische Erfassung für die Programmierung und Generierung von Grafiken relevant. 65

Während Nees und Nake zuerst Programme für Werke realisierten, bevor sie diese in Büchern in informationsästhetische Zusammenhänge stellten, schrieb Herbert Werner Franke 1967 mit "Phänomen Kunst" ein Buch über Informationsästhetik, bevor er 1969 mit den Algebraischen Kurven der Werkgruppe "KAES" 1969 erste digitale Computergrafiken realisierte, deren Kurven schwer in Kriterien für die Maßeinteilung für Ordnung und Komplexität übersetzbar waren. Frankes "experimentelle Ästhetik" war zugleich produktions- und rezeptionsorientiert, mit einem Schwerpunkt auf Letzterem. 66

Die an maschinellen Prozessen ausgerichtete Kybernetik erster Ordnung verhalf den Ingenieurwissenschaften zu einer wissenschaftlich erweiterten `angewandten Mathematik´. Aus dieser Kybernetik erster Ordnung ging die Informationsästhetik hervor, welche die Gestaltung für die menschliche Wahrnehmung ins Zentrum ihrer Überlegungen rückte. Die Kybernetik zweiter Ordnung mit Margaret Mead, Gregory Bateson, Heinz von Foerster, Ernst von Glasersfeld, Gotthard Günther und Humberto Maturana verknüpfte ihre Themen `Kognition´ und `beobachtende Systeme´ in Thesen über Selbstbeobachtung. Gordon Pask antizipierte diese Neuausrichtung mit seinen "learning machines" nicht nur, sondern entwickelte seine Lernmodelle zu einer Konversationstheorie, welche die Zusammenhänge zwischen Lernprozessen und symbolischer Interaktion thematisierte. 67

In diesem Wandel der kybernetischen Forschung verorteten sich die Pioniere der Computerkunst mit Werken und Texten. Sie betonten entweder die Möglichkeiten, Beobachter von kybernetischen Skulpturen in Schaltkreise zu integrieren, oder sie orientierten sich mit Computergrafiken an kognitiven Aspekten der visuellen Wahrnehmung. In aktueller Computerkunst entfällt diese Zweiteilung zu Gunsten einer Pluralität alternativer Präsentationsweisen, die kognitive Aspekte unterschiedlich integrieren.

Wegbereiter für die Kunst der sechziger Jahre und ihre Auseinandersetzung mit Neuen Medien waren nicht nur Buckminster Fuller und Marshall McLuhan 68, sondern auch die Kybernetik. 69 Von einer an klassischen Geisteswissenschaften ausgerichteten Kunstkritik (Hermeneutik und Stilanalyse) wurde die Kybernetik nicht beachtet. 70 Von Kybernetik beeinflusste Computerkunst war exotisch 71 – heute erkennen wir in ihren Urhebern Pioniere, die die Grundlagen der Entwicklung der Computerkunst in den folgenden Jahrzehnten geschaffen haben.

Anmerkungen:

Alle in den Anmerkungen verwendeten Abkürzungen bestehen aus einer Verfasserangabe (Autor oder Herausgeber) und – nach einem Doppelpunkt – dem ersten Substantiv des Titels (Das erste Substantiv wird in der Abkürzung immer im Nominativ verwendet). Bei Titeln, die als erstes Substantiv einen Vornamen mit nachfolgendem Nachnamen aufweisen, erscheint der Nachname in der Abkürzung. Wenn Titel kein Substantiv enthalten, dann wird das erste Wort als Abkürzung verwendet (Untertitel werden nicht berücksichtigt). Danach folgt das Jahr des Erscheinens.
Abkürzung: i.O.m.d.T. = im Original mit dem Titel.

1 Der Begriff "Cybernetics" (und Vorläufer): Wiener: Cybernetics 1948/2007, S.19f. (Zitat S.20). Vgl. Galison: Ontology 1994, S.232; Masani: Wiener 1990, S.251f.; Pask: Approach 1961, S.15f.; Pierce: Introduction 1961/1980, S.208ff.; Wiener: Ich 1971, S.269f.
Leibniz´ Rechenmaschine: Lehmann: Schickard 1995, S.276-286.
Norbert Wieners Interesse an Leibniz: Galison: Ontology 1994, S.255f.; Masani: Wiener 1990, S.219,254; Wiener: Cybernetics 1948/2007, S.19f.
Begriffe wie Zuschauer, Teilnehmer, Rezipient u. a. stehen im Folgenden auch für die femininen Formen Zuschauerin, Teilnehmerin, Rezipientin u. a. Dies geschieht aus praktischen Gründen, weil Alternativen wie "der/die ZuschauerIn", "der/die TeilnehmerIn" oder "der/die RezipientIn" Sätze besonders dann unlesbar machen, wenn die Maskulin/Feminin-Varianten mehrfach in einem Satz durchgespielt werden müssen.

2 Shannon/Weaver: Theory 1949/1998; Wiener: Cybernetics 1948.
Über die Resultate der Kriegsforschung in Shannons "A Mathematical Theory of Communication" (Shannon/Weaver: Theory 1949/1998): Roch: Shannon 2009, S.145: "Shannon arbeitete zuerst in `A Mathematical Theory of Cryptography´ ([Shannon: Theory 1945]) die Antwort für den diskreten Fall sicherer Kommunikation aus, dann in `Transmission of Information´ ([Manuskript] 1947, [Publikation mit dem Titel "Communication in the Presence of Noise": Shannon: Communication Presence 1949]) die für den kontinuierlichen Fall gestörter Übertragung. 1948 führte er Ergebnisse und Ansätze aller Vorarbeiten zusammen in `A Mathematical Theory of Communication´ [Shannon/Weaver: Theory 1949/1998]. Es ging Shannon hierbei nicht nur um die Frage effektiver Kommunikation, sondern konkret um die theoretischen Grundlagen sicherer und effektiver Steuerung für elektronische Flugabwehrsysteme."
Roch: Shannon 2009, S.104, Shannon zitierend: "`When I came out with my paper in 1948, part of that was taken verbatim from the cryptography report, which had not been published at that time.´ [Shannon nach Price: Conversation 1985, S.170] Shannon teilte seinen 114-seitigen `cryptography report´ für die wissenschaftliche Öffentlichkeit lediglich in zwei Teile: Einen eher Kommunikationstheorie und einen eher Chiffren betreffend."

5 Norbert Wiener arbeitete im Auftrag des NDRC (National Defence Research Committee) unter der Leitung von Vanevar Bush (Bluma: Wiener 2004, S.53-69,99-117; Galison: Ontology 1994, S.241f.; Roch: Shannon 2009, S.55-70,74ff.,79ff.).

27 Pask: Comment 1971, S.86: "From the performer´s point of view, training becomes a matter of persuading the machine to adopt a visual style which fits the mood of his performance. At this stage in the development of the rapport, the performer conceives the machine as an extension of himself, rather than as a detached or disassociated entity."

Noll ließ sich nicht von der Informationsästhetik anregen (Klütsch: Computergrafik 2007, S.165f.), lieferte aber mit "Polygonzügen" Georg Nees und Frieder Nake Vorgehensweisen, die mit informationsästhetischen Kriterien weiter zu entwickeln waren. Zugleich zeigt der Vergleich von Programmierweisen zwischen Computergrafik und Computerliteratur, das Erstere Letztere fortführt. Eine frühe und wichtige Vorgabe für die Entwicklung von Computerliteratur lieferte Shannon (s.o.), also entfernt sich auch Noll nicht vom `Schnittpunkt´ zwischen Kybernetik und der Programmierung von Computern.

70 Dies gilt vor allem für die in den sechziger Jahren im englischsprachigen Bereich die öffentliche Meinung über Kunst stark beeinflussenden Vertreter des "modernism", für Michael Fried, Clement Greenberg und Rosalind Krauss.
In Westdeutschland dagegen bildeten in den sechziger Jahren die Autoren informationsästhetischer Texte in den Auseinandersetzungen um zeitgenössische Kunst eine eigene Gruppe (Kurd Alsleben, Max Bense, Helmar Frank, Herbert Werner Franke, Karl Otto Götz, Rul Gunzenhäuser, Siegfried Maser, Günter Otto, Günter Pfeiffer, Hans Ronge). Vgl. Ronge: Kunst 1968.

71 Über die Entwicklung amerikanischer Kunst vom Abstrakten Expressionismus zu Pop Art und Minimal Art als Paradigma für die Geschichte der Nachkriegskunst, auf das Konzeptuelle Kunst nicht zu folgen versuchen, sondern einen "paradigm shift-off" einleiten sollte: Atkinson/Baldwin: Work 1972, S.167. In diesem `Paradigma einer Paradigmenfolge´ fehlen Performance Art, Computerkunst und experimenteller Film: Die Paradigmenfolge, wie sie die zeitgenössische Kunstkritik und der Ausstellungsbetrieb (Museen und Galerien) etablierten, hatte Exklusionscharakter. Mit der Marginalisierung von Computerkunst wurde im Kunstbetrieb (Kunstmuseen, Kunsthandel, Kunstkritik, Kunstgeschichte) auch die Kybernetik an die Peripherie des Kunstkontextes gedrängt.

 As a bio-psychologist I was attracted to cybernetics through the work of Gregory Bateson and his attempt to make an ecological theory of mind.

 I was - and am - looking for an interdisciplinary or even transdisciplinary framework that will allow a theory of information, cognition and communication and therefore also a theory of mind and meaning.

 Bateson's lack of a theory of to whom the difference made a difference brought me to Maturana and Varela's idea of autopoiesis, which I have discussed with them both intensively and written papers using and criticising the theory. You can find my latest description of the limits of Bateson's theory in a chapter in this book:

 http://www.springer.com/life+sci/book/978-1-4020-6705-1 .

 It made many soft Bateson fans angry.

 In my opinion Maturana lack a theory of mind. Therefore I continued into Heinz von Foerster's theories and philosophy and analyzed it in a paper to his 70.th birthday.

 Although his is a bit more realistic then the rest of the very radical contructivistic cyberneticians and he brings in communication as well ( in his corolary to Maturana) as well as necessity of the recognition of the other as real, he does not unfold a theory of the social.

 In search of the I went to Niklas Luhmann. I am very fond of the way he uses and combines the model of three autopoietic systems and have written a lot of that. But I do not think he manages to include a phenomenological first person point of view in his theory although he claims to build on Husserl. I wrote a paper on that in the double issue we did last year in CHK "Luhmann Applied".

 I have ever since studied Peirce's semiotic to find a theory and philosophy of the observer and that no-place in non-time of the origin of meaning, words and cognition that Lou describes so wonderful in his mail. A theory that include meaning, communication and the observer that cybernetics has not managed to produce yet. I have had and have very inspiring discussions with him on this interesting subject when he makes his column 'Virtual logic', trying to convince him that Peirce actually produced something that cybernetic - even second order cybernetics - is in need of. My discussion with Ranulph around his columns have been and still are important for this issue to.

 I have collected my last 25 years of work on that idea in the book "Cybersemiotics: Why information is not enough", that I have finally received a copy of last week.

 http://www.utppublishing.com/pubstore/merchant.ihtml?pid=8894&step=4

 I am looking forward to receive - what must be severe - criticism from many of you of the solution I have attempted there in order to save many cyberneticians from becoming complete relativists and anti-science in order to escape central power and objectivism in order to celebrate the human aspect of human lives and creativity.

 I don't know if I HAVE found cybernetics, or even if there is an IT to be found.

 In my experience I encountered a group of people who like to think about the dynamic configurations of what we perceive, experience, and engage with in any given field. Not only that, but this loosely-knit eclectic group of people are generally aware that they do not have, nor cannot claim, any absolute truths for what they explore.

 I come from a background of systems modeling, (ecosystems and the management concerns that arise) and hence take it as obvious that simulation models are not true, though sometimes very useful. Why should mental models, concepts, beliefs, etc. be any different? My encounter with the biology of cognition as presented by Maturana at the 1995 ASC conference (which I attended for unrelated motives) offered me an acceptable and credible basis for expanding this as a way of reflecting and living in comfort with the lack of Reality.

 What I have appreciated as much as the ideas is the community; the people in ASC, and others I have encountered through the ASC. It is the quality of the conversations in terms of both the content and the mien that has been the core of what I have, in practice, accepted as "cybernetics".

 Thus I became acquainted at a conference, and have engaged as a network of relationships and conversations with a predilection to exploring "how" rather than "what" of "why".

 I had the fortune to meet Jerry Lettvin as a freshman at MIT in 1974. He headed an integrated freshman year program called Concourse whose theme that year was "Mind, Machine, and Meaning". It was a fantastic program -- we had professors who discussed everything from information theory to AI to philosophy of mind to politics of technology to history of mathematics.

 Joseph Weizenbaum gave us a preprint of his book Computer Power and Human Reason, Lewis Mumford came and had lunch with us, Langdon Winner spoke about the politics of autonomous technology, Murray Eden taught us information theory, and professors had informal debates about the ethics of accepting defense grant money. I think we read Wiener's God & Golem and MacKay's Information, Mechanism and Meaning, and perhaps another book on information theory, Symbols, Signals, and Noise. It was far more enlightening and enlivening than the other three years at MIT that followed.... I was already thinking about biology, brains, and machines, but I imagine that many of Jerry's attitudes and ideas found fertile ground in my mind, and that I learned many cybernetic concepts from osmosis.

 Spiritually, I am a theoretical biologist interested in realizing artificial intelligence through biologically-inspired design principles. I came to cybernetics formally as an undergraduate while I was looking for principles that might explain biological evolution and complexification. I thought then and still do now that one needs processes of open-ended complexification and creation of new functions to construct devices capable of autonomous learning. From library forays I came across biological systems theory (Waddington, Pattee, Rosen, Bertalanfy), self-organizing systems, bionics, biological cybernetics, hierarchy theory, systems theory, books like Jantsch's Self-Organizing Universe, autopoiesis, and many others.

 I went to graduate school at SUNY-Binghamton in the Systems Science department seeking to develop a theory of emergent functions (how to design devices that adaptively make their own meanings through their interactions with their environs). Howard Pattee and Robert Rosen were the two people who had thought most profoundly about emergent structures and functions in biological systems. Howard was in Binghamton, one of the few systems & cybernetics programs then in the US. In my doctoral thesis, I developed a taxonomy of self-constructing devices that would be capable of adaptively constructing their sensors, effectors, and coordinative parts (nervous systems), and what this would mean epistemologically. In the course of working on this problem, I found Ashby, Pask, McCulloch, Powers, von Foerster and many others. I was lucky to attend a Gordon conference on cybernetics some time in the mid-1980's and an ASC meeting in Philadelphia where I heard von Foerster, Beer, and Maturana for the first time. A few years later, I came across Pask's electrochemical device in the literature, which was an example of an adaptive artificial device of the type I had postulated, i.e. one that created its own sensors in order to find the right observables that it needs to perform some function.

 As a language and literature researcher (with a bit of mathematical background), I became interested in Structuralism and Semiotics. These theoretical currents have been influenced to a certain extent by cybernetics; to me, however, their connection with the mathematical theory of information and communication appeared to be far from clear. In fact, after reading Claude Shannon's "Mathematical theory of Communication" and Wiener's "Cybernetics" I realized that this connection is hugely problematic and needs a lot of clarification.

 This compelled me to research the subject further, and led me to works such as "Autopoiesis and Cognition" by Maturana and Varela, but also to J. Klir's "Approach to General Systems Theory" and "Facets of Systems Science" and to R. Rosen's "Fundamentals of Measurement and Representation" and "Anticipatory Systems", where I found a lot of things relevant to my interests (in the area of linguistic and cultural communication) but also a lot more problems to be solved.

 I didn't have anyone to guide my approach, because unlike in the 60's and 70's, there isn't that much interest in my field for cybernetics and systems theory, and theoretical trends tend to go in and out of fashion; whatever enthusiasm there was for cybernetics and systems seems to be largely gone, and whatever interdisciplinary interaction there is, has become "specialized" (as in, for example, automated language processing) and taken over by fields like computer science or neuroscience. Mostly, I find, attempts to "break" the disciplinary barriers come, these days, from the other side (e.g. Vilem Novak's "Alternative Model of Linguistic Semantics and Pragmatics" in the IFSR Systems Science and Engineering series). And, as far as I know, they don't have much of an echo in the humanities community. So I was pretty much on my own in my exploration of cybernetics, and the feedback I got so far was largely discouraging. The only encouragement came from Prof. Klir (whose works shaped my understanding of systems and mathematical modelling).

 It was always there,just the word for it wasn't there initially. Since my early memories I was engaged in, and fascinated by, the workings of (my) encounters.

     What does the other know about oneself?
     What can one know about the other?
     How can another get me to know something?
     How can I get another to know something?
     How and why are choices made for others?
     Why should one accept choices others make on one's behalf?
     How does one get to know?
     What can be known?
     What happens in negotiation, what is trust and what are the implications for authority and responsibility? And so on. 

 As a whole, my education drove me away from reflecting myself and my encounters in a process that was generally unpleasant. Objective reality, rationality, accountability and expected answers took the centre stage well into my own studies to become a teacher. In my teacher's examination I had to take too many different tests to study for all of them and I took one on pedagogy for dyslexia entirely unprepared, apart from being dyslexic myself (I am too messy to calculate reliably, a slow reader, I switch numbers, words etc. and only focus well if I am truly interested). In this examination I stated that I find it not acceptable to judge a person's ability to learn on the person's ability to produce expected observable behaviours, that it is not acceptable to label a person who does not display expected behaviour consistently as "disabled" and that I was less concerned about students with learning disabilities than about teachers with teaching disabilities. This (one of many similar anecdotes I can tell) was deemed outrageous and it has almost cost me my degree.

 I found cybernetics during my graduate studies in architecture; i.e. about a decade ago. At the time, I was uncomfortable with the excess of formalism and determinism at school. (I was interested on non-top-down and adaptable design; the post-war epistemological shifts; the challenges brought by poststructuralist' postmodernisms; and the impacts of the so-call Informational Society.)

 It led me to embrace cybernetics themes, and it expanded the framework of my research. (Out of curiosity, I remember to be dissuaded by older colleagues, who saw me as a promising theorist losing his time with a death discipline). I got a special interest on the work and career of second-order cyberneticist Gordon Pask - a humanist who acted as consultant to (among others) Cedric Price - the maverick of British architecture. Then I spent some years doing archival research, including exhaustive research at professor G's personal archive (held by his daughter at the time). It ended in my PhD, and following presentations.

 (In short, the thesis provided a history of exchanges between architecture and the fields of cybernetics, systems research and computation. In particular, it focused on the achievements and encounters of Gordon Pask, Price and Frazer. In short, the first part of the thesis was dedicated to early developments in Cybernetics and architecture, including Pask's career and the rise of C2; the second part focused the rise of a project called Generator; and the third one focused on later achievements of Pask and others up to his death in 1996. It highlights their role in envisioning an evolving environment.)

 As an architecture student, I was set the task of designing a supermarket. I hated the idea, so I set about undermining it by designing an automated warehouse, ordering and delivery system so no one had to visit a supermarket at all. Thus, we could avoid subliminal advertising and other marketing abuses. So I developed a design for an automated warehouse with telephone ordering from a catalogue and delivery (as it happens, by hot air balloon). This we now know as Internet Shopping, but in 1967 it was without precedent.

 I was told that, designing such a complex, technical system, I needed to consult a cybernetician. A what?

 Fortunately, my architecture school had one of these strange creatures on board as a consultant, and I went to meet him. In my memory, I spoke for 3 hours, quite unclearly, and then had what I could not express summarised with astonishing clarity in 3 minutes by the strange creature. I was astounded, and certain that the subject had something to do with this. So did the man, who was Gordon Pask. I was captivated, by both.

 Some years later, Gordon told me he had got me a scholarship, and so, with no prior preparation and no knowledge of the academic world, I signed on to study for a PhD under Professor Andrew Gordon Speedie Pask.

 I read Weiner's "Cybernetics", published in 1948. The sub-title pulled me in: "or control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine."

 For me, it was fortunate that the text was rich with ideas because because the mathematics was incomprehensible.

 In 1947 I had adopted Korzybski's Science and Sanity as my 'bible' (pub. 1933). I found immense satisfaction there, probably because at fourteen in 1938 I had started reading scientists like Eddington and Bertrand Russell's "Why I'm not a Christian."

 This got me kicked out of my home, but I survived nicely.

 In 1952 visiting the Korzybski General Semantic headquarters in Lakeville CT. I bought "Design for a Brain- Ashby". (I still have that original book published that year!) Then in 1956 his "An Introduction to Cybernetics."

 My next major epistemological advance was in 1972, reading "Steps to an Ecology of Mind" - Bateson.

 That book put everything I'd ever read into a new comprehensive framework. Here was a book that invoked both Korzybski and Cybernetics as reference points.

 The summer before I went to college, in 1973, I picked up a book from the public library, called Our Own Metaphor, by Mary Catherine Bateson. It narrated in a conversational way a conference about our ecological predicament, which had taken place in 1968 and which had been organized by her father Gregory Bateson, who was then teaching at the University of California, Santa Cruz. I already knew that I would be attending U.C. Santa Cruz that fall, in the residential college Kresge College which had a focus on humanistic psychology. Thus it was as a freshman one of the first courses I enrolled in was Kresge 152, "Ecology of Mind." I was to take four courses from Bateson during my undergraduate years.

 My attraction to Bateson's work came from a confluence of interests. In psychology I was interested in alternatives to behaviorism that could enhance human potential. In cultural anthropology I was interested in culture and its variability. And in ecology I was interested in how we could understand the ecological crisis that I felt was the issue of our times. Bateson added to these a kind of biological emphasis: he had us as a homework exercise look at a living thing, and then try to describe how we knew it was living.

 I had the opportunity to create my own major, but I didn't do that. However, I once proposed that I do so to Bateson. I had in mind a major in "cultural planning." His response was that I should indeed try to envision how to do cultural planning, until the time should come when I would emerge from that study with a "belly laugh." Because I would realize that "it can't be done." You can't plan culture. "You can't deal with love in that way."

 I continued with undergraduate and graduate training in anthropology, eventually under Roy Rappaport at The University of Michigan, a student of Bateson's. I got increasingly out of step with trends in anthropology, explicitly purporting to repudiate both Rappaport and Bateson, though I now see how some of those trends can be reframed and understood in terms of second order cybernetics.

 As a Human Factors Engineer, I designed systems and interfaces. The emphasis was on cognition rather than anthropometrics. I did this for many years in different formats (cockpit controls, paper flows, conveying systems, etc.). The conditions of the design were always 'utility' and sometimes subjective assessment. I worked happily inside of, never questioning (and rightly so) the validity of, human limits that are well documented in the human factors, ergonomics and engineering domains.

 In the 90's, while working for the Boeing Co., I was assigned a research project into the area of managing human error (Boeing being keen to keep airplanes from falling out of the skies). The scope of our project quickly expanded from pilot error, which was the industry standard at that time, to include the production and maintenance of airplanes as well. This expansion was new thinking and very political as the agencies that monitor such things (FAA, NTSB) had a stake in the outcome. Our definition and mathematical probabilities were suddenly under much scrutiny, especially by ourselves, and required historical and legal explanations.

 The definitions and algorithms being used for human error (really meaning lapses in human understanding) made no sense. Yet they were documented to some degree and the values accepted - although no one could say for sure where the values came from (an error will occur 1 out of 20 times, for instance). The legal definitions and systems set up for self-disclosure (ie., admitting you screwed up so we could analyze and design for it) that hinged on these definitions, and especially allowances for pilots versus mechanics, made even less sense.

 The irony: the project was a huge success. Many airlines around the world participated. The net result: error rates stayed exactly the same although we managed to adopt a few new definitions and flaunted an expanded scope. While writing the concluding report, I turned briefly to systems theory, esp related to complexity, throwing in a few of Peter Senge's dizzying, circular, +/- graphics that were all the rage about then.

 It was here I began to feel the grumbling of discontent. I HAD to learn something about systems theory that could explain our experiences inside this project but, more importantly, I wanted to frame human understanding in a more useful manner. I signed up at Antioch University in Seattle for an advanced degree in Wholistic Systems and along the way got introduced to Bateson, von Foester, Maturana (and many of the people in this society). It was shocking to find myself falling down that rabbit hole. What was more shocking was my complete abandonment of business systems in favor of human systems.

 Back in 1970s-80s Cybernetics was thought as a way to break through the ruling Maxism ideology by a number of pioneer intellectuals in China. Cybernetics, System Theory and Information Theory became my major focus while I was a university student. My first reading was Norbert Wiener's Human Use of Human Beings, followed by reading related sections in Encyclopaedia of Computer Science, a gift to me from the author of Engineering Cybernetics (TSIEN Ssue-Shen, 1954), along with his other articles promoting "System Engineering" as an improvement of China's management. During 1981-1986 I was deeply involved in the group of China's young reform-minded activists and took cybernetics ideas as a medicine to heal the "brain-damage" of our generation from the brain-washing-education force-fed to us, as well as a driving force to participate the efforts of reforming Chinese society. I was among the ealiest group in China to use System Dynamics modeling to deal with social-economic issues (such as in contracted governmental "Five-Year Planning" research projects).

 In 1986 I went to U.S. and studied under Stuart Umpleby as a visiting schoolar for two years, during that time, introduced by Stuart, I met Heinz von Foerster, Stafford Beer, Gordon Pask, Humberto Maturana, Robert Trappl, Klaus Krippendorff and many other colleagues in ASC. I started publishing in journals such as Cybernetics and Systems (1988, 1991) and CATO Journal(1991) on cybernetics related topics. I went back to China in summer 1988 but having to leave again in summer 1989 after the Tiananmen Square massacre. From 1990 to 1994 my Ph.D. work in management and organizations under Stuart's advisary was focused on cybernetics and system theory and since then I was considered a "Chinese cybernetician" in various conferences in U.S. and Europe. (But after "911" I decided to become an American citizen, or a "world-citizen", so lost my Chinese citizenship.)

 My current work seems within the field of organizational development, group dynamics, oriental organizational behavior, cross-cultural communication, and organizational learning etc., but they are all related with cybernetics.

 As an aspiring academic, sophomore at Oberlin College in 1983, I was contemplating a poor math degree while encountering the mystery of the concept of "information". I constructed an individual major in Cognitive Science, reading in cognitive philosophy, computer science, semantics, and linguistics. Wandering the library stacks I found Kenneth Sayre's _Cybernetics and the Philosophy of Mind_, Valentin Turchin's _The Phenomenon of Science_, and von Bertallanfy, Ashby, and Krippendorf. Professors led me to Bateson and Semiotic Theory, and I ended up writing an honors thesis laying out the framework for probabilistic representations of semiotic information (entropic modeling) as a basis for a universal evolutionary science (while still also taking the math degree).

 After college, while working as a software engineer, I was introduced to Stuart Umpleby and attended the 1986 Conference of the Society for General Systems Research. This led to enrolling at SUNY Binghamton in 1987 to study under George Klir, Howard Pattee, and Valentin Turchin (then at CUNY). While studying the breadth and depth of the Systems Sciences, Cybernetics, and Semiotics, I took an MS and PhD in Systems Science there by 1994. I joined the ASC and the SGSR (now the ISSS) which I have been a member of since, and attended their conferences for many years; founded CYBSYS-L, the first (to my knowledge) electronic forum for cybernetics and systems, in 1988; with Turchin co-founded the Principia Cybernetica project in collaborative development of a cybernetic philosophy in 1989; and co-authored "The Cybernetic Manifesto" with him in 1990.

 Found the book "Laws of Form" by G. Spencer-Brown in 1974. Taken by the beautiful and profound formalism for a calculus of distinctions. Changed my perception of foundations of mathematics and foundations of epistemology. Related to prior reading about Buddhism and (partly) orthodox Jewish upbringing, coupled with recent (1972) PhD in Mathematics. Paticipated in a seminar on Laws of Form in Chcago from 1974 onward to about 1977. Paul Uscinski and I worked on the reentering mark. Then encountered Francisco Varela's work and also Heinz von Foerster's review of Spencer-Brown. We once called Heinz on the phone about our seminar. Much laughter! Visited Francisco Varela in late 1970's and wrote paper "Form Dynamics" with him. Went to summer sessions at the Naropa Institute in Boulder Colorado in early 1980's and taught Laws of Form there. First cybernetics conference, hosted by Heinz von Foerster, in Pescadero California in 1982. Have participated in cybernetics since that time.

 I studied design at the Ulm School of Design, a post war avant gard institution in Germany, now famous because it no longer exists. Norbert Wiener gave a lecture there before I became a student but the topic of cybernetic continues in discussions. In 1959, to learn English, I took a summer job in Oxford England where I bought two books, Ashby's Introduction to Cybernetics and Wittgenstein's Tractatus. I can't say that I fully understood either of them at that time but they turned out most influential to my academic future.

 I got a fellowship to study at Princeton University. as a academic green horn, I hated this place. Students were snobbish and arrogant and I found nothing there of what I came to study. In search of a better university I passed through Urbana, talked to a design professor there who told me about Heinz. I visited BCL and told Heinz of the catalogue of my interests. He mentioned in passing that Ashby was at U of I and teaching a course in cybernetics. This made my decision to stay there.

 I studied with Ross. After the one year course was over, I organized a cybernetics club with his former students. I managed to get Ashby on my dissertation committee together with social science professors. My dissertation was about content analysis as a methodology. I wrote one chapter for Ashby, developing a set theoretical information theory to quantify the amount on information needed to make the kind of inferences that content analysts make. I graduated in communication which I considered close enough to cybernetics and design.

 I became a professor of communication at the University of Pennsylvania and in 2000 I received an endowed professorship for cybernetics, language, and culture, named after Gregory Bateson whom I had invited and who had taught in my seminar.

 My main interest is in the dynamics of scientific communication and technological innovation, and my background is in sociology. Since coordination among people is based on communication and control, this brought me to socio-cybernetics. Actually, I approached this field (during the second half of the 1980s) via studies about entropy statistics because entropy statistics allowed me to combine multivariate and time-series analysis of scientific communications.

 Scientific communication self-organizes into paradigmatic structures, e.g., disciplines and specialties, and these processes can be measured in terms of distributions of co-occurrences of words and cited references. Entropy statistics enables us to statistically decompose and relate these processes quantitatively at different levels of aggregation (e.g., articles, journals, sets of journals, etc.).

 The autopoiesis model of Maturana & Varela was used by Luhmann for modeling interhuman processing of meaning. By providing meaning, an anticipatory system (Rosen, 1985) models the historical events from the perspective of hindsight and selects from a horizon of possible meanings. This generates intentionality. I am interested in using models increasingly available in the computation of anticipatory systems (Dubois) for addressing research questions about intentionality and its communication at the supra-individual level (Husserl).

 I was a junior in high school, when I first read Norbert Wiener's _Cybernetics_, and I did not understand much of it, but I got the sense that it was profoundly important. A few years later, while studying comparative religion, I encountered the more lay-friendly _The Human Use of Beings_, which opened my eyes to a whole new world*: everywhere I looked, I found people finding niches everywhere they looked; saw how their intentions became encoded in their circumstances, and how their circumstances, in (re)turn, informed their intentions. I enrolled in a vocational program in industrial electronics and robotics, with academic interest to understand automation and how language translated to mechanical activity (I am reminded of Jewish golems: clay statues animated by inscriptions of holy words). My technical education soon facilitated a career developing enterprise resource planning systems, but all the while, I continued studying religion, and eventually focused on magic (often differentiated from religion by its emphasis on efficacy). I also continued reading everything I could find about cybernetics.

* Rather, it partly opened my eyes to such things as I described, and partly confirmed observations I had already made but had not expressed so eloquently as Norbert. Reading _The Human Use of Human Beings_ felt like returning to a familiar and validating setting, and it also encouraged me to consider things I had not previously.

My interests were (and are) creativity, musical composition, and understanding of learning/knowing. In 1967 Herbert Brun told his acoustics class (in which I was enrolled) that he and Heinz von Foerster were conducting a course on "heuristics." From there I took many courses with Heinz and Herbert, both separately and together. I became a graduate student member of BCL and Heinz and Herbert became my thesis advisors. Heinz and Herbert had very different views about language. Their opposing views and their collaboration resulted in my learning to take care language.

I met Gordon (Pask -Ed.) in 1974 in his office in Richmond by the first time and we have been in touch until his death. My thesis last 11 years to be completed (!!!!) (Gordon told me since the very beginnings that it would not last less than 8-10 years and asked me whether or not I would accept it I obviously accepted the challenge not only because we loved him (my wife and I) and Elizabeth far beyond the professional relationship but also due to the nature of the theme This happened in a day that I shall never forget: 15 March 1975, a historical day with deep connotations (it was the day in which Julius Caesar was murdered and in Rome there was the celebration of an old Pagan ritual related to the Spring Equinox). At the same time that Gordon proposed the theme of my thesis (in those temporal conditions) he invited me to be a Professor in the Chelsea College. Thanks to him I have been in contact with the 'big bosses' of cybernetics: Maturana, Varella, Lars Longfren, Heinz, Ernst von Glass, etc., as well as men and women of other fields (History, Epistemology, Logics ,etc.). For example, Margaret Borden, Karl Popper and John Eccles were suggested by him (together with Zadeh) as members of the jury of my PhD examination.

My thesis was entitled "Science as a Growing System" and although my background belong (primarily) to the realm of physical sciences (I got a Master Degree as Electronic Engineer) I had a broad interest in humanistic disciplines (I had been a free student in the humanistic university of Lisbon for some years). At the same time I was engaged in a psychoanalytic process. So, Gordon was clever enough to bind all these areas and the "growing science " he referred to was deeply related to the rational and IRRATIONAL processes that had framed the construction of the successive Images of Nature from the Sumerians (!!!) until the Renaissance, using his system (CASTE) and my fuzzy logics. In the present-day terminology the thesis entailed a historical-scientific perspective of the emergence of those Images as a non-trivial (state-transition) fuzzy machine.

After the thesis, he suggested me to deepen and erect some models of human affections and cognate irrational processes using my psychoanalytic knowledge (this in an epoch in which everybody's attention was focused on logical reasoning only). This stage last several years and finally some day in 93, in the Atheneaum Club in London we had a very serious conversation about the future of cybernetics and the possibility of endowing consciousness to machines ("Which type of machines?"). This topic has framed my research in the last 7 years.

This has been a long journey and a long message. But you can see how influent Gordon (and the people I knew by means of him, as for instance Heinz ) was/were not only in my research path but also in my own vision of the world.

From my perspective, cybernetics found me, more than once. It found a freshman in college, seduced by the viewpoints of Jerome Y Lettvin, a biologist, which i was not.

It found the prepared mind (see above) of a researcher and Ph.D. student in Negroponte's lab (when it was called The Architecture Machine Group, before the Media Lab), seduced by the personae of Gordon Pask.

It found my antagonism for AI in all its reductionist castration of the experience of living. It satisfied my desire for a science of being human. It created a method for me to write software, solve problems, guide design (my own and others'), and live more aware and contentedly in the swarm of complexity that we live in .

I had a narcissistic, but highly intelligent professor, who, based on his expertise in the philosophy of Ludwig Wittgenstein, promoted a synthesis of constructivism and realism, constructive realism (CR). He introduced me to Heinz von Foerster, and both of them supported me in re-writing his CR as a cybernetic theory in accordance with Heinz's relativity principle. ("If a Hypothesis holds separately for A, and it holds separately for B, it can only be accepted if it also holds for A & B together.") I finally wrote a paper as a feedback loop expressing how my ways of understanding and not-understanding bring forth my understanding of this theory; through the very process, my understanding of this theory brings forth my understanding and perception of myself as a writer and reader (observer)of this theory.(Understanding Understanding Understanding Not-Understanding Pawlik 2005) I guess what made it attractive for Heinz and irritating for most others was that through this peculiar form the paper could be re-viewed as merely describing a theory of how one constructs his world, describing a way of using language for which this theory is an example or simply describing how the world is; thus, the position of the observer varyingly disappears, reappears, inside or outside the presented form or not existing at all, depending on your interpretation of what can not be said. (Reflections on the meaning of the unknowable build the axis of the papers epistemological structure)

An academic pause followed in which I focused on teaching Taiji chuan, Qigong and family Gongfu style, during which only a few papers again relating to the subject of self-reference got published.

Still my interest in cybernetics was preserved through a lasting dialogue with Barbara Vogl and my assistance in the development of Heinz's last book "Part of the World". Eventually this led me to write my Ph.D. thesis, in which the context of the development of the personal and professional relationship to Heinz and his work is used to show how his idea of "Systemics" as unity of both art and science, professional and personal, could be realized in a systemic Ph.D. thesis. (Patterns of Re-generation; Wissenschaftspoesie as a public private affair, Pawlik 2006). In brief, I used the context of writing a thesis to become aware of how my work re-generated my life and my personality, as well as the other way around and showed how I perceive this dynamic of re-generation and act upon it to regenerate the patterns of re-generation within which I perceive myself living in this world. This is done in the form of a poem containing poems within poems, stories within stories, various cybernetic papers of self-referential structure as well as a small epistemological treatise explicating the epistemological pattern of propositions on which my work is based. Naturally the thesis can also be read as a story telling how this thesis came into being, a dissertation about the writing of my dissertation.

My first contact with the word "cybernetics" was in a required electrical engineering course called "Elements of Communication". The textbook for the course was Ross Ashby's "An Introduction to Cybernetics". It was my favorite course as an undergraduate (the instructor was excellent). I particularly enjoyed the exercises in the book. It was fun! My next contact was in a graduate operations research (OR) course. Some of the "modeling" concepts in Ashby's book were also present in OR--Markov processes, dynamic systems, etc. Again, I thought it was fun! Later, in an MBA course on Organizational Theory, cybernetic concepts re-emerged under the umbrella of systems theory - homeostasis, entropy, information, feedback, self-organization, etc. This time, however, I began to see how the concepts might be used to address what I regarded as disturbing organizational and social issues, both locally and globally. Although no longer "fun" in the initial way I had experienced, for the first time I had a sense of direction with respect to what I wanted to study and advance.

When I selected a doctoral program, one of the criteria I used was that there had to be courses I could take with the word cybernetics in the title. The University of Pennsylvania was the only institution I found with such courses. These courses were in the Annenberg School of Communication and I was in the Wharton School, so I sought out the Professor who taught the courses. Thus began my tutelage under Klaus Krippendorff, who became my teacher and mentor, and later colleague and friend. I learned that I could not address the seemingly intractable social issues I had identified without including myself in the issues I was observing, and being open to changing my formulation of those issues and my desires with respect to them. It was Klaus who convinced me to present my first paper, "Beyond Planning", at a general systems conference (while ASC was on a six year hiatus), at which I had a chance to hear, and in some cases meet, Heinz von Foerster, Francisco Varela, Ernst von Glasersfeld, Margaret Mead, Stuart Umpleby and others. When Stuart asked me to organize the first meeting of a re-established ASC in 1981, my future with cybernetics was assured. Not only did I continue to confront new ideas and ways of thinking, I also found the people who I met and with whom I talked to be fascinating in their variety and creativity.

Subsequently, I had opportunities to work with Gordon Pask when I hosted him for three 8-week Guest Lecturer residencies at Old Dominion University and had many conversations with Herbert Brün over a period of almost 20 years. These interactions (and many with others--e.g., Rod Donaldson, Annetta Pedretti, Mark Enslin, Susan Parenti, Steve Sloan, Judy Lombardi, to name just a few) have proven key in the formulation of "my cybernetics". I regard the "Urbana circle" (and the School for Designing a Society) to be a continuing source of inspiration as I refine and alter my ideas further.

I encountered cybernetics as an undergraduate in psychology (1964-68). David Stewart, still active today in the UK Cybernetics Society, gave a course of lectures on cybernetics and I was hooked. I was persuaded psychology needed to be scientific and needed a better way than behaviourism. Cybernetics offered that - and more.

I read Miller, Galanter and Pribram's (1960) book on Plans and the Structure of Behaviour, a key text marking the rise of cognitive psychology and, eventually, 'cognitive science'. The authors make clear their indebtedness to cybernetics. I also recall W Sluckin's Men, Minds and Machines as a good introductory text.

Thanks to David Stewart, I spent 6 months working with Gordon Pask at System Research Ltd as a research assistant. I took a Pask paper (A Cybernetic Model for Some Kinds of Learning and Mentation), a 50 plus (!) page conference paper and worked through its 70 or more references in order to understand it. This was one of the most intense learning periods of my life. It lead to my getting a good degree and becoming committed to cybernetics.

After I graduated, I went back to work with Pask. I was with him until 1978, witnessing, amongst other things, the birth of conversation theory after many years of gestation. On the way, I gained a PhD in cybernetics from Brunel University.

My name is Bill Seaman. I am Chair and Graduate Program Director at Rhode Island School of Design in the Digital+Media Department.

Here are some snippets that trace my interest in cybernetics...

I'll start with a quote...

    "Cybernetics, a word coined by Norbert Wiener to describe the complex of sciences dealing with communication and control in the living organism and in the machine." When Wiener introduced the term, which is derived from the Greek ... meaning governor or steersman, he was unaware that it had already had a considerable history and that it had been used more than a century before by Andre Ampere to cover the purely governmental side of such a theory, in the positivistic classification of scientific theories. 

As a matter of fact not only Ampere... but Plato had used the word... (which would be transliterated as "cybernetics") in Gorgias. Although Plato used the word more or less in relation to the art of navigation, it is highly interesting, as pointed out by Watanabe, that Plato compared cybernetics with rhetorics because he viewed both as concerned with influence and control entirely different in nature from knowledge of some fixed reality such as astronomy or geology. "(Wiener, 1985, p.215)

WIENER, N. 1985. Norbert Wiener: Collected Works with Commentaries. Cambridge/London: MIT Press I came in contact with Cybernetics first while studying at MIT in 1985 through Wiener's writing.

WIENER, N. 1967. The Human Use of Human Beings; Cybernetics and Society. New York: Discuss Books.

I later became focused on Cybernetics during my study at the Center for Advanced Inquiry in Interactive Art, University of Wales, with Roy Ascott functioning as my advisor. Ranulph often visitedá One of the other students was writing on Gordon Pask and this opened my deep interest in him. And of course Bateson came up often in discussion. Later I met Peter Cariani also . He was interested in Pask and we have become good friends. See his impressive website: http://homepage.mac.com/cariani/CarianiWebsite/CarianiHomePage.html See also BATESON, G. 1972. Steps to an Ecology of Mind. San Francisco: Chandler Publishing, Co.

Roy Ascott saw the potentials of behavioural relations in terms of works of art. In his paper entitled Behaviourist Art and the Cybernetic Vision, published in 1966, Ascott presented the following concept:

"Behaviourist Art constitutes, as we have seen, a retroactive process of human involvement, in which the artefact functions as both matrix and catalyst. As matrix, it is the substance between two sets of behaviours; it neither exists for itself nor by itself. As a catalyst, it triggers changes in the spectator's total behaviour. Its structure must be adaptive implicitly or physically, to accommodate the spectator's responses, in order that the creative evolution of form and idea may take place. The basic principle is feedback. The system Artefact/Observer furnishes its own controlling energy; a function of an output variable (observer response) is to act as an input variable, which introduces more variety into the system and leads to more variety in the output (observer's experience). This rich interplay derives from what is a self-organising in which there are two controlling factors; one, the spectator is a self-organising subsystem; the other, the art work is not usually at present homeostatic...

There is no prior reason why the artefact should not be a self-organising system; an organism, as it were, which derives its initial programme or code from the artists creative activity and then evolves in specific artistic identity and function in response to the environment which it encounters. "(Ascott, 1966, p.11)

My Ph.D thesis was entitled: Recombinant Poetics: Emergent Meaning as Examined and Explored Within a Specific Generative Virtual Environment, c1999. I have many texts on my website including this one at billseaman.com. I have a history of interest in works that explore meta-meaning systems...

I got all of the Macy Convention books and read them one summerá I collaborated on a paper with Andrea Gaugusch:

(Re)Sensing the Observer Offering an Open Order Cybernetics (billseaman.com)

Andrea Gaugusch & Bill Seaman

What we need now is the description of the "describer" or in other words, we need a theory of the observer. (Heinz von Foerster, Observing Observers)

Abstract

Instead of presuming the "observer" as given, we are (re)sensing the observer and are thereby offering an "Open Order Cybernetics" (OOC). We are first of all concerned about our use of language as the precondition for any meaningful statement. This self-reflexive point of departure distinguishes our project from philosophers who are first of all presuming "something" ("senses", "objects", "subjects", "language" etc.) without being aware of their presumptions i.e. that they are already able to talk meaningfully about "something". We are undertaking a self-reflexive loop towards our already undertaken meaningful actions, reflecting inside of our concepts on our concepts, trying to find out how our concepts about "something" have come into existence. We are reflecting on our concepts through this on-going open investigation. We are sketching the ramifications of such a self-reflexive loop for epistemology as well as for the main research-areas within cognitive science (i.e. language-acquisition, perception, consciousness). We are also pointing towards the arts and virtual reality as awareness-aids, helping us in our self-reflexive endeavors.

More recently I have been collaborating with Otto Rossler, theoretical biochemist and physicist on the creation of an Electrochemical Computer and developing a model for an intelligent, situated robotic system. We are currently working on a book entitled Neosentience. A number of papers can also be found at billseaman.com related to this project.

Pask early on articulated the following : Chemical computers arise from the possibility of 'growing' an active evolutionary network by an electro-chemical process.

Pask, G. 1961. An Approach to Cybernetics, with a preface by Warren S. McCullock, Harper and Brothers, MIT press (pg. 105)

Ranulph has done a lovely write up on this book.

I have of late been reading:

Mechanisation of Thought Processes Proceedings of a Symposium held at the National Physical Laboratory on 24-27th November 1958 Volume II. National Physical Laboratory Symposium No. 10. London: Her Majesty's Stationery Office 1959, p. 879

Physical Analogues to the Growth of a Concept by Gordon Pask Introduction

In this paper I discuss the circumstances in which we can say a machine "thinks", and a mechanical process can correspond to concept formation. My point of view about this question is as follows. It is reasonable to say that a machine does or does not "think", in so far as we can consider the working of the machine as in some way equivalent to a situation or an activity, (for example, riding a horse), which is familiar, and in which we ourselves are used to taking a part. Thus, when I speak of "thought", (as when saying a sonata is written, or a hairpin is invented, as a result of "thought"), an end product is introduced on which to hang the thinking process. The process itself is a descriptive expedient, a king of analogy. Clearly the sonata was not written "by thinking", (in the sense of "by magic" or "by using a computor").

I volunteered at the Gesundheit! Institoot (http://www.patchadams.org) in WV for many years, during which I would regularly see a poster promoting the School for Designing a Society (http://www.designingasociety.org). I paid it little heed- one of the many fantastic projects in the world.

In my early twenties I did a lot of work with education, conflict resolution, and facilitation, especially with grassroots organizations that aspired to model/instigate social change (a la lefty politics). A time came when I decided I would go on a tour of intentional communities (www.ic.org) to determine what such communities described as their needs with regard to conflict resolution. I would then, in light of their described needs, pursue training that would make me useful and relevant to meeting them. My first stop was to be SDAS, in Urbana, IL. I was going to go for a week, but Mark Enslin convinced me to get the full experience I would need to be there the whole session, one month.

When I arrived there, Steve Sloan, who had taught cybernetics, was no longer active in body as a teacher. However, a group met weekly, often hosted by Ben Emerick, which was called, 'Cybernetics'. I didn't know what it was, and the class didn't teach me.

There was a scribe who took notes about the content, and a meta-scribe who wrote the content of the content-carriers: the loop of herself describing the selves describing the environment and content they observed themselves observing. There was a lot of silence and descriptive sentences. These descriptions ornamented conversation rooted in a short piece of introductory content such as the distinction between 'complicated' (many elements) and 'complex' (many relationships).

In Urbana, at SDAS, I was challenged consistently, for the first time in my life, to hold my language accountable to my desires. What did my sentences do for or against my interests? In the past I would say very interesting things, or quite banal things, and the response rate was nearly identical. I'd learned at age 14 that I could put very little effort into my schoolwork and still be praised. At SDAS, what I did was measured against what I said I wanted to do- I had social support for self-observation! I knew this had something to do with second-order cybernetics (which was described to me in terms of a radio controlled car). I didn't know what cybernetics was, though. I liked myself in this environment so much I stayed on a few extra weeks. As I departed, people encouraged me to move there.

When I returned to Worcester, MA, I received a song written about me living in Urbana. I had never been in an environment which noticed my noticing and valued it so!

Visiting a friend, I went to UMASS and looked up cybernetics in its huge library. My response consisted of many large tomes in technical language about artificial intelligence. This was a far cry from my beloved conversations. It was clear I would not learn about cybernetics alone.

For these reasons, and more, I collected my things and moved to Urbana and SDAS for as far as the eye could see (which is a good while, considering how flat it is here in the mid-west).

There are several threads to this, perhaps starting with my becoming enchanted by constructivism through being introduced to this via George Kelly's 'Personal Construct Psychology' (PCP).

I have a PhD in an area of biology which is astride both animal and human nutrition, completed while I was an academic in agriculture at the University of what is now Zimbabwe. Following this I took opportunities to gain a qualification in human nutrition in London, migrate to Australia and obtain a position in a new medical school in Adelaide to set up and run a graduate course in Nutrition and Dietetics.

A student, Chris Bell, who had just done an honors degree in virology came to me to say that he wished to do a PhD with me. Very quickly we came to the mutual recognition that our interest lay not in biological type questions but rather 'Why do people choose to eat what they do in particular contexts?'

Deciding to pursue this was fateful, to say the least! For although this was fascinating to us it was not one that we were academically prepared for, nor was it a medical question. Both very severe constraints in a new institution wishing to establish its reputation for hard nosed biomedical research.

We did not have a clue as to where to begin in addressing our question. And observed, in tune with a comment we saw in 'Science': 'That in the early stages of a research and development project you can see ... absolutely nothing!'

A 'chance' finding of a book called 'Frames and Cages' - on PCP - by Chris led us to follow our passion by seeking understanding of decision making about food choice through this constructivist approach.

To cut a long (and tortuous) story short the (very fine, in my opinion) PhD was completed and granted (in the early 80's, with some difficulty) but produced no career option for Chris as we had opened up a new field of enquiry Ð which is not meant to happen in a PhD program! While I have not kept a close look at the field I am not aware of anyone else working up the notion that food has no meaning except what we supply to it. And that there are very useful systems analytic models which can greatly assist in understanding the kinds of belief which underly these meanings in diverse contexts.

Moving on ... In 1980 Prof Jack Farquhar, head of the world's first major community health initiative on heart disease (The Stanford Heart Disease Prevention Program) visited Adelaide. He expressed great interest in the 'constructivist' approach to understanding food choice that I was engaged in and invited me to spend time with his group. This led to my being a Senior Fulbright Scholar at Stanford in the second half of 1981.

It was during this time that I had a truly life changing experience. This was meeting Heinz and Francisco while attending a conference entitled 'Disorder and Order'. For what I heard from them excited me greatly. I obtained a copy of the proceedings and recordings of their presentations.

And took these back to Adelaide to have lively discussions about them with a small group of interested people. This included Allen E Ivey, a visiting scholar, who was very encouraging. (Writing this brought Allen to mind; we have not had contact for many years).

This led me to set up the 'Cybernetics Group' with a colleague and great friend, John Graham. We kept this going for over 10 years from the mid 80s to 90s, with meetings 3-4 times per year.

A wide range of topics chosen loosely focused on self organizing systems. Some of which were informed by 'Autopoiesis and Cognition' and by 'The Tree of Knowledge.' Others from jamming on drums!

Among the 'happenings' of our lively group which emerged from these influences was bringing Humberto to Adelaide, twice. This was in collaboration with Relationships Australia (formerly Marriage Guidance Council).

And a most enjoyable visit by Ranulph to my home for a meal and conversation with a group of stalwarts about matters cybernetical.

I began my undergraduate studies in engineering at the U of Illinois. I was told that engineering was "the application of science to the solution of human programs." That was exactly what I wanted. However, for my taste the engineering curriculum had too many machines, too little science, and too little discussion of human beings and societies. I really liked the style of thought in physics. I attended the physics colloquium (guest speakers) as often as possible. I covered some of the talks, e.g., Edward Teller, for the campus newspaper. I expanded my curriculum into a 5 year program, earning a BS in mechanical engineering and a BA in political science. For graduate school I chose political science (decision-making in large social systems). However, I felt the people in political science, while trying to be scientific, did not understand science as I had learned it through physics. From time to time I heard Ross Ashby or Heinz von Foerster speak on campus. I was impressed. I felt they were speaking about information processing and decision-making in a manner consistent with the philosophy of science. So, I started hanging out at BCL and reading BCL publications.

As a doctoral student in communications I worked in the Computer-based Education Research Laboratory (the PLATO system) developing computer-based communication media (what we now call the internet). I and a group of graduate and undergraduate students received several grants from NSF and the C.F. Kettering Foundation. (see http://www.gwu.edu/~umpleby/afp.html) We used cybernetics as the theoretical framework for this research. One or more of the grants was administered by BCL.

I have been interested in cybernetics since the time I bought (1949) the very first edition of « Cybernetics » at Herman et Cie in Paris. The following year I founded the «Cercle d'Etudes Cybernétiques », under the aegis of Louis de Broglie and the approval of of Wiener. In 1951 I published the first communication to Académie des Sciences containing the word « cybernétique » in its title. In 1954 I spent three months at MIT (Foreign Students Summer Project) and visited Wiener both at his home in Cambridge and his country house at Tamworth.

I published many papers in the fields of cybernetics and systems, introducing « observation operators » (1951-1957), the use of information for wave functions (1968), « structure transfers » (1975), a generalization of Laplace transform (1986), « epistemo-praxiology » (1987), new views on the perception of duration (1991), « epsilon distribution » (1994). In 1995 I published a book : Çlaquo; Cognition et Systme Èraquo;. One of my recent papers is about Heinz von Foerster (2006).

While I was professor at Université Paris-Nord, I became President of « Collge de Systémique » (1981-1984), Editor in Chief of « Revue Internationale de Systémique » (1987-1989) and Honorary Fellow (1979) of the « World Organisation of Systems and Cybernetics » (WOSC). Then, Professor emeritus (1985), I was awarded the « Norbert Wiener Memorial Gold Medal » (1990), and, after being Director-General from 1987, I became President (2003) of the WOSC and (2008) Honorary President of AFSCET (French association for systems sciences).

I resonated with Phil Guddemi's remarks as I, too, was at the University of California, Santa Cruz at the same time but under different circumstances. I had escaped my role as a Palo Alto housewife and returned to school as a single Mom, caring for two teenage boys and a daughter experiencing her first taste of 'higher' education. It's probably understandable that Phil and I don't remember meeting, even though the campus was small and I, too, was an Anthropology major.

I was completely carried away by Bob Scholte, a Dutch Anthropologist who was interested in the Ethnology of Anthropological Traditions and who introduced me to French Structuralism and Claude Levi Strauss' aesthetic rigor where the 'goal requires an affective, historicist orientation' which attempts 'to understand the past for the sake of the past' and 'by suspending judgment as to present utility, we make that judgment ultimately possible.' Bob became my intellectual guru and, like a passionate schoolgirl, I was captured by the poetry of Levi Strauss' words. 'Like the pebble which marks the surface of the wave which circles as it passes through it, I must throw myself into the water if I am to plumb the depths.'(Levi-Strauss, Tristes tropiques, 1955:396)

Bob Scholte was a protege of Gregory Bateson and was the one who arranged Bateson's coming to UCSC. Gregory was the man I didn't quite understand but I would never miss his invitation to our class to gather in his living room for conversation and I attended all his lectures. I knew what he was saying was important. He was like an itch I could not quite reach to scratch. I think I was learning through osmosis and when, later, after a year of discovering that no one 'understood' Levi-Strauss in Allan Dundees' Department of Folklore at UCBerkeley, I found a post graduate course in Cybernetics at San Jose State University created by Bill Reckmeyer. Thus began my formal training in cybernetics.

I was also fortunate to have had Bela H. Banathy for my tutor in Systems Thinking in Education leading to a M.Ed. and the beginning of PATTERNS which was originally sponsored by the Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development (ASCD). It wasn't until I became acquainted with Heinz von Foerster and Humberto Maturana that I gave up on the Educational System as a hopeless dinosaur and admitted that the exploration of the cybernetic perspective is that which gives me pleasure and therefore would be the impetus for the publication of PATTERNS .

My legal blindness went undiagnosed until age 9, masked by adaptations sensitizing me to my own phenomenology and circularity as the essence of persistence / stability.

At 12 I first read Wiener and Ashby, within the already distorted context of cybernetics being about robots and 'intelligent' computers. After 3 decades of doggedly steering counter to the positivistic / objectivistic mindset AI entailed I found I'd circled back to cybernetics, navigating via waypoints not always strongly associated with the field.

Undergrad studies in anthropology (Mead, Bateson) and psychology (Lewin, Angyal) led to exploring 'systems' and tangential topics (Fuller, von Bertalanffy, von Foerster, Spencer Brown). Graduate studies in - and rebellion against - AI and 'cognitive science' led me to Maturana, Varela and Pask. When American academia self-admittedly failed at supporting my quest I moved to Sweden, where 'cybernetics' wasn't a quaint anachronism. Doctoral work recasting collaborative decision support systems in terms of observers and languaging sealed my fate (branded a 'cybernetician').
